<p>http://blog.stephencleary.com/2009/05/detection-of-half-open-dropped.html</p>

<p>TL;DR: if you don&#8217;t write, you have no way of knowing whether your
connection is still alive.</p>

<h2>Does setTimeout wait til until the end of the event loop to start ticking?</h2>

<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t:</p>

<pre><code>  var endOfEventLoop;

  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("" + (+new Date() - endOfEventLoop) + " ms after end of event loop");
  }, 1000);

  var now = +new Date();
  while((+ new Date()) - now &lt; 900) { /* spin for 900ms */ }
  endOfEventLoop = +new Date();
</code></pre>

<p>yields:</p>

<pre><code>  101ms later
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>Because if you&#8217;re using magic numbers to, say, open a popup after some
animation has occurred, you&#8217;re opening yourself up to disaster / timing
errors if, after setting your timeout, a lot of slow computation /
rendering logic eats up a chunk of that timer.</p>

<h2>Primary Key</h2>

<p>A primary key is just a column with the follow constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>NOT NULL</li>
<li>UNIQUE</li>
</ul>


<p>Note: you can have multiple NOT NULL / UNIQUE columns, but only one can
be marked as PRIMARY.</p>

<h2>observeOn vs subscribeOn</h2>

<p>http://reactivex.io/documentation/scheduler.html</p>

<blockquote><p>As shown in this illustration, the SubscribeOn operator designates which thread the Observable will begin operating on, no matter at what point in the chain of operators that operator is called. ObserveOn, on the other hand, affects the thread that the Observable will use below where that operator appears. For this reason, you may call ObserveOn multiple times at various points during the chain of Observable operators in order to change on which threads certain of those operators operate.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Roth IRA</h1>

<p>&#8220;IRA&#8221; stannds for Individual Retirement Account.</p>

<p>http://www.rothira.com/roth-ira-taxes-and-tax-issues</p>

<blockquote><p>Roth IRA contributions are not taxed at the time you contribute the funds to your Roth IRA. However, your contributions come from post-tax income. You pay taxes on your income today, but not in the future.</p></blockquote>

<p>What does post-tax income mean? If I make 80k pre-tax, let&#8217;s say my
post-tax income is 60k. If I want to put $5k into a Roth IRA, then I&#8217;m
down to 75k and 55k. OH I get it&#8230; I think. The amount the government
takes from me grows as I make more money. I&#8217;d benefit me if I were able
to put 5k into Roth before I was taxed, so that then my taxable income
would be 75k, and I&#8217;d have to pay the gov less than if I were taxed
based on 80k.</p>

<h1>Random acts of optimization</h1>

<p>http://engineering.riotgames.com/news/random-acts-optimization</p>

<h1>Readline</h1>

<p>TODO: figure out how to get your tmux / bash setup working. Shouldn&#8217;t
be rocket science. Goal: get irb and psql working.</p>

<h1>ORDBMS</h1>

<p>Object-relational database management system. Postgres is this. MySQL is
not; MySQL is just RDBMS.</p>

<blockquote><p>An object-relational database (ORD), or object-relational database management system (ORDBMS), is a database management system (DBMS) similar to a relational database, but with an object-oriented database model: objects, classes and inheritance are directly supported in database schemas and in the query language. In addition, just as with pure relational systems, it supports extension of the data model with custom data-types and methods.</p></blockquote>

<p>An Object Database leverages pointers over joins for collecting data,
where as a the relational approach leverages foreign keys,
denormalizing, and storing everything in tabular format. Pros to Object
Database include no mental model mismatch between your programming model
(often OOP) and database storage; create an obj, modify an obj, save an
obj &#8211; no need to figure out how to express your object in tabular
format.</p>

<p>Disadvantages are that any sort of reporting / querying needs to be
programmed in, whereas relational databases follow set/relational theory
and if you&#8217;ve got things stored in a tabular format you have way more
flexibility to modify / query your database in the future.</p>

<h1>Postgres</h1>

<p>Developed at Berkeley as POSTGRES, pioneered many concepts later adopted by
commercial databases. Sponsored by DARPA. Didn&#8217;t have SQL (btw SQL has
been around since the 70s). SQL added in Postgres95, became PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>Comes with a bunch of binaries:</p>

<p><code>postgres</code> the server; accepts connection and then starts a worker
process to handle that connection. (Can verify this; spinning up a
rails console creates one more postgres worker instance).</p>

<blockquote><p>Thus, the master server process is always running, waiting for client connections</p></blockquote>

<p><code>psql</code> shell looks like <code>mydb=&gt;</code> for regular users, <code>mydb=#</code> for
superuser.</p>

<p>Commands prefixed with <code>\h</code> are not SQL; everything else is SQL.</p>

<p>A relation = mathemtical term for table.</p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model</p>

<p>All data sets represented as tuples, grouped into relations.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;A relation is a data structure which consists of a heading and an unordered set of tuples which share the same type,&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h1>Deviations of SQL from relational model</h1>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model#SQL_and_the_relational_model</p>

<ul>
<li>SQL allows duplicate rows; relational model does not. Practically
though this is avoided by auto-incrementing.</li>
</ul>


<p>SQL apparently also allows anonymous columns, duplicate rows, etc, which
make things impossible to reference due to indistinguishability.</p>

<p>SQL includes &#8220;NULL&#8221; to imply missing data; comparison of NULL with
itself is not true, but NULL. (Comparison of anything with NULL yields
NULL; it means unknown, not determinable). And hence it&#8217;s a form of
three-valued logic, rather than just boolean.</p>

<p>Law of exclude middle: It states that for any proposition, either that proposition is true, or its negation is true.</p>

<p>Relational model depends on this law, but SQL does not, since it allows
for NULL. Apparently Codd (relational model inventor) eventually
suggested a 4-valued logic, probably to differentiate NULL from UNKNOWN,
only to have a bunch of smug guys suggesting 19 or even 21-valued logic.
WAT. So Postgres just stuck w 3 valued logic.</p>

<p>SQL also uses NULL for other things than value unknown: the sum of an
empty set is NULL.</p>

<p>Rows are grouped into tables/relations. Relations grouped into database.
Databases managed by a single Postgres server instance is a cluster.</p>

<h1>Joins</h1>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM wats, foos;
</code></pre>

<p>Gives you a combination</p>

<pre><code> name | name | wat
------+------+------
 foo1 | bar1 | wat1
 foo1 | bar2 | wat2
 foo2 | bar1 | wat1
 foo2 | bar2 | wat2
 foo3 | bar1 | wat1
 foo3 | bar2 | wat2
</code></pre>

<p>Or even</p>

<pre><code> name | name | wat  | bazname
------+------+------+---------
 foo1 | bar1 | wat1 | baz1
 foo1 | bar1 | wat1 | baz2
 foo1 | bar2 | wat2 | baz1
 foo1 | bar2 | wat2 | baz2
 foo2 | bar1 | wat1 | baz1
 foo2 | bar1 | wat1 | baz2
 foo2 | bar2 | wat2 | baz1
 foo2 | bar2 | wat2 | baz2
 foo3 | bar1 | wat1 | baz1
 foo3 | bar1 | wat1 | baz2
 foo3 | bar2 | wat2 | baz1
 foo3 | bar2 | wat2 | baz2
</code></pre>

<p>If any of those tables had zero rows then zero rows would be selected
even if there&#8217;s data in the other tables.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is widely considered good style to qualify all column names in a
join query, so that the query won’t fail if a duplicate column name
is later added to one of the tables.</p></blockquote>

<p>You could also rewrite the first one as</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM foos INNER JOIN bars ON true;
</code></pre>

<p>So selecting * seems to select from all relations/tables involved.</p>

<p>Aggregate functions can&#8217;t be used in WHERE clauses, since WHERE clauses
are limit the input rows, recursive infinite etc blah blah.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT city FROM weather WHERE temp_lo = max(temp_lo);
</code></pre>

<p>You can change this to a subquery</p>

<pre><code>SELECT city FROM weather
    WHERE temp_lo = (SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather);
</code></pre>

<p>Aggregates play nicely with GROUP BY clauses: here&#8217;s how you&#8217;d count
many rows had the same values.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, count(*) FROM bars GROUP BY name;
</code></pre>

<p><code>HAVING</code> is like a WHERE clause for grouping / aggregate functions.
Specifically, WHERE filters the input rows, and HAVING filters the
results after aggregation has taken place:</p>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/a/287496/914123</p>

<h2>Referential integrity</h2>

<p>Making sure foreign keys point to objects in the table.</p>

<h2>Window functions</h2>

<p>Similar to GROUP BY, but instead preserves each input row in the
output set rather than coalescing them down to just one row; in other
words, instead of boiling down to a single answer per group, window
functions add that answer to as a column to each of the input rows.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT depname, empno, salary, avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname) FROM empsalary;
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa this is pretty awesome:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT depname, empno, salary,
       rank() OVER (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM empsalary;
</code></pre>

<p>&#8220;For each row, the window function is computed across the rows that fall into the same partition as the current row.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kinda like how aggregate functions are computed using rows with the same
GROUP BY value.</p>

<p>There partitions and there are window frames&#8230;</p>

<p>A window frame is a subset of a partition (or the whole partition
itself). Many window functions use window frame rows, though some
use partition rows. By default, if ORDER BY is supplied <em>to the
over clause, not the whole query</em>, then the window frame consists
of the all rows from start of the partition through to current row,
plus any following rows that have same ORDER BY value&#8230;</p>

<p>WAT.</p>

<p>There must be some good reason for this. Can&#8217;t think of it now.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT salary, sum(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) FROM empsalary;
</code></pre>

<p>But the thing to keep in mind I guess is that the <code>ORDER BY</code> here is
just another way to configure the partition + window frame. Maybe that&#8217;s
the way to think of it: <code>OVER</code> clauses are used to specify both
partitions and window frames all in one shot. PARTITION BY is one way,
that specifies a partition where window frame is the partition, and
ORDER BY is another, where the PARTITION is all the rows (filtered by
WHERE) and window set is from start to current row.</p>

<p>Window functions can only be used in the SELECT list and in ORDER BY. I
guess that makes sense. Can&#8217;t use them in GROUP BY, HAVING, or WHERE,
since they logically execute after those things.</p>

<h2>Aggregate expressions</h2>

<pre><code>---                   direct arguments                   aggregated arguments
aggregate_name ( [ expression [ , ... ] ] ) WITHIN GROUP ( order_by_clause ) [ FILTER ...
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>The argument expressions preceding WITHIN GROUP, if any, are called direct arguments to distinguish them from the aggregated arguments listed in the order_by_clause. Unlike normal aggregate arguments, direct arguments are evaluated only once per aggregate call, not once per input row.</p></blockquote>

<p>So the stuff in <code>WITHIN GROUP(...)</code> are evaluated once per input row. So
ideally we should minimize the stuff we put in there.</p>

<blockquote><p>This means that they (direct arguments) can contain variables only if those variables are grouped by GROUP BY;this restriction is the same as if the direct arguments were not inside an aggregate expression at all.</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>SELECT percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY income) FROM households;
 percentile_disc
-----------------
           50489
</code></pre>

<p>0.5 is a direct argument; it makes no sense for it to be substituted
with a value that varies across rows.</p>

<p>So for example you could do:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY num) from nums;
 percentile_disc
-----------------
               3
</code></pre>

<p><code>percentile_disc</code> is an aggregate function. It&#8217;s going to spit out
values that are the result of coalescing rows. It wouldn&#8217;t make sense
for me to try and add the column <code>name</code> to this result, because the
<code>percentile_disc</code> result is based on coalesced rows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY num) from nums;
ERROR:  column "nums.name" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
LINE 1: SELECT name, percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY num...
               ^
</code></pre>

<p>The only way that&#8217;d make sense would be to GROUP BY <code>name</code> so that the
aggregate function is only being applied to groups grouped by name
rather than all of the input rows at once:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY num) from nums GROUP BY name;
  name  | percentile_disc
--------+-----------------
 alex   |               3
 justin |               2
(2 rows)
</code></pre>

<p>Wow this stuff is weird to talk about.</p>

<p>Note that <code>count</code> is not an &#8220;ordered set&#8221; aggregate:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, count(*) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY num) from nums GROUP BY name;
ERROR:  count is not an ordered-set aggregate, so it cannot have WITHIN GROUP
LINE 1: SELECT name, count(*) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY num) from nums ...
                     ^
</code></pre>

<p>It barfs because I tried to provide a <code>WITHIN GROUP</code> clause to a non
ordered set aggregate <code>count</code>. If I remove my WITHIN GROUP clause, I
get:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, count(*) from nums GROUP BY name;
  name  | count
--------+-------
 alex   |     6
 justin |     3
(2 rows)
</code></pre>

<p>So what is an ordered set aggregate? It just means an aggregate fn
whereby performing the computation requires some kind of ordering. My
hunch is that ORDER BY inside of WITHIN GROUP isn&#8217;t used just for
&#8220;sorting&#8221; the rows, but for defining the key by which they&#8217;ll be
grouped. Or that&#8217;s just my bullshit way of fitting it into my brain.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(*) as unfiltered, count(*) FILTER (WHERE i &lt; 5) as filtered FROM generate_series(1,10) AS s(i);
 unfiltered | filtered
------------+----------
         10 |        4
</code></pre>

<p>So why <code>count(*)</code> and not <code>count()</code>? Because <code>count</code> is an aggregate
function I guess, and that&#8217;s one why to distinguish it from something,
say, <code>version()</code>.</p>

<h2>Type casts</h2>

<pre><code>CAST ( expression AS type )
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as</p>

<pre><code>expression::type
</code></pre>

<p>You can cast any string literal:</p>

<pre><code>select '4.123'::real;
 float4
--------
  4.123
(1 row)
</code></pre>

<p>Postgres implicitly casts things for you, e.g. assigning values to
columns (because the column type is obviously known). In some cases you
have to be explicit; Postgres works this way so as to not surprise you
with silent type casts.</p>

<h2>Collation</h2>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4538732/what-does-collation-mean</p>

<p>It means how words/letters/phonemes are stored.</p>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>must be rectangular</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ARRAY[ARRAY[1],ARRAY[1,2]];
ERROR:  multidimensional arrays must have array expressions with matching dimensions
</code></pre>

<h2>Composites</h2>

<pre><code>CREATE TYPE myrowtype AS (f1 int, f2 text);
SELECT ('1',2)::myrowtype;
</code></pre>

<h2>Order of expression evaluation</h2>

<p>Left-to-right short-circuit eval is not a thing:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT true OR somefunc();
</code></pre>

<p>Hence the above <em>probably</em> won&#8217;t run <code>somefunc</code>, but not because it&#8217;s on
the right and the left side evals to true, but because the evaluator&#8217;s
already gone thrugh and decided that it can do less work by only using
the left side.</p>

<p>CASE constructs defeat optimizations by forcing evaluation, so you could
write the above as</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CASE WHEN true THEN true ELSE somefunc() END;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CASE WHEN true THEN true ELSE false END;
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty awesome. Declarative all the way. Let the evaluator figure
out the best way to go.</p>

<p>One gotcha is though is that the evaluator might try and simplify
constant subexpressions (subexpressions that don&#8217;t depend on any rows
being looked up), so something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CASE WHEN num &gt; 0 THEN num ELSE 1/0 END FROM nums;
ERROR:  division by zero
</code></pre>

<p>This happens because <code>num</code> is dynamic and the evaluator will evaluate
the <code>1/0</code> before even running the query, causing the divide by zero
error.</p>

<h2>Foreign keys</h2>

<blockquote><p>A foreign key must reference columns that either are a primary key or form a unique constraint. This means that the referenced columns always have an index (the one underlying the primary key or unique constraint); so checks on whether a referencing row has a match will be efficient.</p></blockquote>

<p>Makes sense:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE lols ( thing_id integer REFERENCES nums(num) );
ERROR:  there is no unique constraint matching given keys for referenced table "nums"
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Since a DELETE of a row from the referenced table or an UPDATE of a referenced column will require a scan of the referencing table for rows matching the old value, it is often a good idea to index the referencing columns too.</p>

<p>Because this is not always needed, and there are many choices available on how to index, declaration of a foreign key constraint does not automatically create an index on the referencing columns.</p></blockquote>

<p>So if an article has many comments, then <code>comments.article_id</code> is an FK,
hence <code>article.id</code> must have unique constraint. But if the referenced
article is deleted, then postgres needs to scan the <code>comments</code> table for
all rows referencing the deleted article to perform some logic on it. So
you probably want to index <code>comments.article_id</code>. That said you probably
want to index it anyway since you&#8217;ll be doing many comment lookups for a
given article.</p>

<h2>Postgres wiki</h2>

<p>https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Main_Page</p>

<p>This seems surprisingly badass.</p>

<h2>Schemas / clusters</h2>

<p>The only data shared b/w databases is users and groups.</p>

<p>But schemas aren&#8217;t kept so separate; a database can have multiple
schemas, multiple schemas can have tables w the same name.</p>

<h2>Table Expressions</h2>

<p>Think of WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and others as modifiers that ultimately
produce a table that you can select from. Holy shit that would have made
my life so much easier if I knew that.</p>

<h2>Joins</h2>

<pre><code>FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T2isequivalenttoFROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON TRUE
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>WHERE</code> filtering happens after <code>ON</code> criteria. Again this is a
case of JOIN just being a thing that produces another virtual table and
WHERE filters whatever table.</p>

<h2>Subqueries</h2>

<p>Use them when you can&#8217;t use joins:</p>

<ul>
<li>subquery is a grouping / aggregation</li>
</ul>


<p>VALUES can also be a subquery.</p>

<h1>Sedition</h1>

advice.</p>

<h1>Open-ended mutual funds</h1>

<p>Open-ended in that if you buy into a mutual fund, the shares granted to

the total market value divided by the number of shares present.</p>

<h1>Intestacy</h1>

<p>State of having died but not written a will. Intestacy law deals with

<li>withdraw money taxed at a (presumably) lower tax bracket when you&#8217;re older</li>
</ul>


<h1>Forvo.com</h1>

<p>Pronunciation dictionary; let&#8217;s people upload recordings of

<h1>Inner Join conditions via WHERE/JOIN</h1>

<p>Already know you can do</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a,b WHERE a.wat = b.foo AND a.bleh &gt; 5;
</code></pre>

<p>But you can also move the join conditions to the JOIN &#8230; ON:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a INNER JOIN b ON (a.wat = b.foo) WHERE a.bleh &gt; 5;
</code></pre>

<p>These are equivalent, whichever you choose is a matter of style.</p>

<p>Note that it only applies to INNER joins: the WHERE version of the above
only produces INNER joins; if you want outer, use the OUTER JOIN ON
syntax.</p>

<blockquote><p>The ON or USING clause of an outer join is not equivalent to a WHERE condition, because it results in the addition of rows (for unmatched input rows) as well as the removal of rows in the final result.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whereas INNER joins are reduced unions of both tables, and hence
expressable as WHERE, which is used for filtering out rows. In other
words, you can&#8217;t <em>add</em> rows to a result set with WHERE; WHERE is only
used for filtering, and OUTER joins can add rows to the result set.</p>

<h1>The WHERE clause</h1>

<p>Typically references at least one column referenced in table generated
in the FROM clause.</p>

<h1>GROUP BY</h1>

<blockquote><p>Grouping without aggregate expressions effectively calculates the set of distinct values in a col- umn. This can also be achieved using the DISTINCT clause (see Section 7.3.3).</p></blockquote>

<p>Makes sense.</p>

<p>We can actually verify that the postgres evaluator reduces this to the
exact same query plan:</p>

<pre><code>diff &lt;(psql -c "EXPLAIN SELECT DISTINCT name FROM foos") \
     &lt;(psql -c "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM foos GROUP BY name")
</code></pre>
