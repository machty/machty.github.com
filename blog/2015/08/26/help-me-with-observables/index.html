	<div class="entry-content"><h2>How do I do this with Observables (or CSP or alternatives)</h2>

<p>I build/maintain <a href="http://www.expresscheckouapp.com">Express Checkout</a>,
a hybrid app, which means it&#8217;s an Ember.js app running in an embedded
browser within an iOS/Android app that occasionally calls into the native app layer
to do native-specific things like turn on the camera, scan barcodes, register
for push notifications, etc.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been fascinated with <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/observable.md">Rx Observables</a>
for some time now and have used them to clean up a lot of the code in my
app that deals with asynchronous behavior and concurrency. But there&#8217;s
one part of my app I&#8217;ve been avoided refactoring with Observables
because I just can&#8217;t wrap my head around how to approach it and express
it with Observables, hence I&#8217;m enlisting any functionally-minded
Observables veterans to help me think about how to structure this.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Situation</h2>

<p>In our hybrid web app, we have a screen that allows shoppers to scan
barcodes on items in a store. To navigate to this screen, a few things
must happen, in the following sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shopper taps a &#8220;Start Shopping&#8221; button</li>
<li>The app fetches the current shopping session from the server</li>
<li>Once the session is fetched, we transition to the Ember.js route
called <code>scan</code>. I use the Ember animation/transition library
<a href="https://github.com/ef4/liquid-fire">Liquid Fire</a>, so the route
transition causes a sideways full screen transition as you would
expect from any iOS app.</li>
<li>Once the sideways transition finishes, we call into the native code to
turn on the camera/scanner</li>
<li>Once the camera/scanner is turned on, we remove the white CSS
background from the screen to reveal the native camera behind our
transparent webview, and from here on out the user can scan barcodes,
add items to their cart, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>The part I&#8217;d like to focus on specifically is the timing of turning on
the native camera and removing the white background. Note the following
constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>on both iOS and Android (though way worse on Android), turning on the
native camera while there is any sort of visual transition/animation
in the webview causes all sorts of hideous jank; this is why we
transition in with a white BG and only hide the BG after a few hundred
milliseconds after turning on the native camera</li>
<li>if the user immediately taps the back button (either on the screen or
android&#8217;s back button) immediately after transioning to the <code>scan</code>
route, any unnecessary camera or visual churn should be avoided: if
the camera hasn&#8217;t been turned on, don&#8217;t turn it on; if the white
background hasn&#8217;t been removed, don&#8217;t remove it</li>
<li>on the flipside, when transitioning out of the scan route, before we
do the sideways transition, we want to 1) re-enable white bg, 2) turn
of camera and wait a few hundred ms, and then 3) do the sideways
tranasition</li>
</ul>


<p>Right now, I handle all these cases with a state machine, but given all
the different entry/exit/abort possibilities, it&#8217;s ugly and complex.
I&#8217;ve had much success replacing similar async-managing state machines
in my app with Observables, so I&#8217;d like to do the same here, if
possible.</p>

<h2>A First Stab at the Problem</h2>

<p>One of the nice properties of Observables is that they know when they&#8217;ve
been subscribed-to and when they&#8217;ve been desubscribed-from. This
property alone is what makes Observables cancellable (unlike Promises,
that go go go until their predetermined chain of callbacks have run to
completion, regardless of whether anyone&#8217;s still listening).</p>

<p>For this problem, my intuition was to model the native camera as an
observable, as well as the white background that needs to become
transparent once the camera is good and ready.</p>

<p>With this approach, I can pretty elegantly model the series of events
that happen when transitioning into the <code>scan</code> route in a cancellable
manner:</p>

<pre><code>let enableCameraObservable = Observable.create(() =&gt; {
  cordovaService.turnOnCamera();

  // we could also have this observable be the thing that emits
  // scan events, since scan events can only happen while this
  // observable is still alive, but that's beyond the scope

  return () =&gt; {
    cordovaService.turnOffCamera();
  };
});

let makeBackgroundTransparent = Observable.create(() =&gt; {
  // set background to transparent
  return () =&gt; {
    // according to Observable.create API, this returned function
    // fires when the observable is de-subscribed; hence we can
    // use it for cleanup and setting the background back to white
  };
});

liquidFireDoneTransitioning()
  .delay(100)
  .flatMap(() =&gt; enableCameraObservable().delay(100))
  .flatMap(() =&gt; makeBackgroundTransparent())
  .takeUntil(routeTransitionAttempt)
  .subscribe((scanResult) =&gt; {
    // ...
  });
</code></pre>

<p>The chain of operators above is terse but expressive; it describes the
following behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li>wait 100ms between the sideways Liquid Fire transition and turning on the camera</li>
<li>wait 100ms between turning on the camera and making the background transparent</li>
<li>throughout all of this, watch for routeTransitionAttempts, and if any
of them come through, stop whatever we&#8217;re doing with the previous
observable. This means: 1) the camera will be turned off&#8230; only if we
ever got to the point that it was turned on, and 2) the background
will be reset to white&#8230; if it ever got to the point that it was made
transparent. In other words, the dispose functions for each observable
are only called if they were ever subscribed to.</li>
</ul>


<p>Possible timeline of events</p>

<ul>
<li>0: <code>liquidFireDoneTransitioning</code></li>
<li>50ms: if <code>routeTransitionAttempts</code> fires, nothing happens</li>
<li>100ms: <code>enableCameraObservable</code> is subscribed-to; camera is turned on</li>
<li>150ms: if <code>routeTransitionAttempts</code> fires, only
<code>enableCameraObservable</code> dispose function fires, turning off the camera</li>
<li>200ms: <code>makeBackgroundTransparent</code> is subscribed-to; background is
made transparent, revealing native camera view</li>
<li>250ms and after: if <code>routeTransitionAttempts</code>, both <code>enableCameraObservable</code> and
<code>makeBackgroundTransparent</code> subscriptions are disposed, the camera is
turned off, the screen turns to white.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is actually pretty elegant for the most part; writing a more
imperative version of this code would involve way more code, that
managed manually setting / cancelling timers, based on how far along the
process was before a later <code>routeTransitionAttempt</code> was made. And it&#8217;s
these kind of refactorings that have cleaned up code all over the app.</p>

<h2>Async Disposables?</h2>

<p>But there&#8217;s one major omission here: making the disposals async. For
anti-jank performance reasons, we need the disposals to be
staggered on the way out, just as they are staggered on the way in, and
we need the <code>routeTransitionAttempt</code> to be delayed while it waits for
this process to complete.</p>

<p>And this, my functionally-minded Rx-experienced friends, is where I am
at a loss and would appreciate your advice. I can&#8217;t seem to settle on a
pattern that maintains the elegance of the disposable native camera
and transparent backgrounds cleaning up after themselves, because those
disposables happen right at the same time. Of course I could throw some
hacky <code>setTimeout</code>s in there, but then I&#8217;m just introducing more
potential race conditions and trying to sweep what should be additional
observables/subscriptions under the rug. Of course, I&#8217;m happy to do that
pragmatically to ship a feature, but I&#8217;d really like to understand how
to better structure these interactions in a Observable-minded manner.</p>

<p>So please, if you&#8217;ve got some ideas that might set me straight, I&#8217;d love
to hear them; please comment below or hit me up at
<a href="https://twitter.com/machty">@machty on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Also, if you see this as something that could be more
appropriately/easily solved by CSP, I&#8217;d love to hear what that&#8217;d entail.</p>
