<p>Scenario: mobile app, I have a back button, I don&#8217;t want it to cause
another transition if the app is in mid-transition.</p>

<p>Mid-transition means:</p>

<ul>
<li>data has already started loading for a target route, or</li>
<li>some animation is underway, e.g. liquid fire</li>
</ul>


<p>Present day Ember:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>willTransition</code> hook to check some &#8220;isTransitioning&#8221; state (which you
have to remember to properly set and unset (though ember could/should
probably provide this for you))</li>
<li>some other router reopen hook, override transitionTo behavior. Pretty
crappy.</li>
</ul>


<p>React w react-router:</p>

<pre><code>Router.run(routes, function (Handler) {
  // custom data-loading logic, construct your own chain of promises
  // ...
  // maybe use flatMapLatest so that you're only responding to the
  // most recent transition, and then eventually:
  // React.render(&lt;Handler/&gt;, document.body);

  // this could be modeled by a stream 
});
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm so I want to be able to push values into a stream (let&#8217;s call it raw
stream), but have it only come out the other side if some other&#8230;
stream? predicate? allows it.</p>

<h2>Rx/Bacon Diagrams</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bacon: <code>flatMapConcat</code> (or <code>flatMapWithConcurrencyLimit(1)</code>)</li>
<li>Rx: <code>concatAll</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Flatten, preserve order of previously started streams (buffers later streams)</p>

<pre><code>...{1}
......{2........3}
.........{}
............{4}
{...1..2........3.4}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Bacon: <code>flatMap</code> (or <code>flatMapWithConcurrencyLimit(infinity)</code>)</li>
<li>Rx: <code>mergeAll</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Flatten, don&#8217;t preserve order (no buffering). (limiting concurrency
means buffering).</p>

<pre><code>...{1}
......{2........3}
.........{}
............{4}

produces
{...1..2.....4..3}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Bacon: <code>flatMapLatest</code></li>
<li>Rx: <code>switchLatest</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Flatten, unsubscribe from previous streams, RIGHT when the new stream
begins, not on its first value!</p>

<pre><code>...{1}
......{2........3}
............{4}

produces

</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>...{1}

<h2>CircleCI uses ClojureScript/Om</h2>

<h2>MRR</h2>

<p>Monthly recurring revenue: a way to calculate monthly revenue based off
of multiple dissimilar subscription terms.</p>

<h2>Observable of 1 is a promise</h2>

<p>http://www.infoq.com/presentations/async-programming-netflix</p>

<p>Promises can&#8217;t be cancelled.</p>

<ul>
<li>Work is already being done (in flight)</li>
<li>No way to stop it</li>
</ul>


<p>Observables are lazy. You can build a giant nested logical chunk of
observable but nothing happens until, say, a <code>forEach</code> subscribes to the
result of an observable that all the internal logic kicks into place.
Not true for promises (unless someone implements a lazy thennable).</p>

<p>TODO: hot vs cold observables distinction? does this exist in bacon?</p>

<p>This is how the <code>retry</code> operator works&#8230; in the same way you can call
<code>forEach</code> N times on an observable and kick start all the internal
logic/event handlers, retry will internally do this until it gets a
non-error response.</p>

<p>This is unless promises, which have the <code>.then</code> operator:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regardless of whether you call <code>.then</code>, the promise logic has already started</li>
<li>Calling <code>.then</code> at the same time just subscribes to the single,
already running promise, and <code>.then</code> on an already resolved promise
just returns that.</li>
</ul>

<h2>phone it in</h2>

<p>http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=phone+it+in</p>

<blockquote><p>Perform an act in a perfunctory, uncommitted fashion, as if it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>She sang the National Anthem, but she was just phoning it in as far as I could tell.</p></blockquote>

<h2>ENZ in Trojan ENZ</h2>

<p>It refers to the reservoir tip at the end (ENZ = ends) to prevent fluids
from leaking from rubbing.</p>

<h2>Clojure: &#8220;classes&#8221; not coupled to namespace</h2>

<p>In Clojure, given you have, say, a Person record, you can extend Person
to two different protocols that have the same method name (so long as
those protocols are in two different namespaces. This is a nice because
in, say, Java, you might be implementing methods from N different
interfaces, yet (possibly unnecessarily) sharing the same private data
and other items on the same namespace.</p>

<h2>defrecord</h2>

<pre><code>(ns alex/wat)

(defprotocol ALEX (lol [a]))

(defrecord AlexThing [a b c]
  ALEX
  (lol [a] (println a)))
</code></pre>

<p>err clearly i&#8217;m doing something wrong&#8230; this is null pointer
exceptioning.</p>

<h2>can&#8217;t use recur and get polymorphism</h2>

<p>Unlikely to bite, but worth pointing out that whatever you pass as the
first arg to <code>recur</code> won&#8217;t dynamically dispatch, because <code>recur</code> is
really just a looping construct. I can&#8217;t see how this would actually
matter though? Maybe I don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<h2>ISeq, IPersistentStack</h2>

<p><code>I</code> stands for interface.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Dispatch</h2>

<p>Dynamic dispatch is the selection of which method to run in a
polymorphic setting. Which implementation of <code>foo</code> should run here?</p>

<pre><code>(foo thing)
</code></pre>

<p>From what I understand, Clojure will look for protocols that specify
<code>foo</code> and check if <code>thing</code> is part of that. If a protocol is found but
<code>thing</code> doesn&#8217;t implement it, then boom, but Clojure will also try and
find a multi-method. (TODO: figure out the order of resolution?)</p>

<p>Multimethods can be simple and dispatch on the type of some map
property, or it can run a more complicated functions to determine which
to run. I believe the difference between this and switch-on-type
inheritance is blah blah blah write this later.</p>

<h2>wtf is a graphics context</h2>

<p>Wtf is context is general. Is it unavoidable that this word be used all
the time?</p>

<p>https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/dq_overview/dq_overview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001066-CH202-TPXREF131</p>

<p>It comes up in so many graphicsy shit. It kinda just means &#8220;where all
state is stored&#8221;.</p>

<p>You have an Engine, where all the API logic (and maybe hardware
interfacing logic) lives, and you have to feed it different contexts to
operate on.</p>

<p>Both Quartz and famo.us describe the context as a &#8220;drawing destination&#8221;;
in Quartz you could apply the same butterfly-drawing routines to both a
page that you want to print on, or a bitmap graphics context, or a
window context (obtained by your application from the window server).</p>

<h2>Opqaue Data Type</h2>

<p>A data type whose interface is incompletely specified, and only
internal, private fns/methods have access to its internals. e.g. the
Quartz 2D graphics context is an opaque data type; you don&#8217;t/can&#8217;t care
what its internals are but you know you have to supply it to all API
calls (or like OpenGL you might be able to swap out the current graphics
context).</p>

<p>Usually the context includes the canvas that you&#8217;re drawing to, current
fill color, depth of field settings, etc.</p>

<h2>Rx Marbles</h2>

<p>http://rxmarbles.com/</p>

<ul>
<li>sample: Use one stream to control the sample rate of another.</li>
<li>startWith: create a new stream that immediately emits a value</li>
<li>distinct: remember past values, prevent refires</li>
<li>distinctUntilChanged: pretty much just &#8220;uniq&#8221;? prevent duplicate
values in a row</li>
<li>findIndex: return the index of the stream</li>
<li>pausable: zip two stream, true/false values of one starts/stops the
flow of the other: HINT HINT HINT can totally use this for pausing
streams during animations / route transitions / any async shit!</li>
<li>pausableBuffered: remember/buffer the paused items, fire them once
&#8220;true&#8221; comes in!!!!!!!</li>
<li>skip/take: skips or takes the first N elements</li>
<li>skipLast/takeLast: skips or takes the last N elements of the stream;
is smart enough to start emitting values if the buffered size exceeds
N, rather than naively waiting for the stream to run to completeion</li>
<li>skipUntil: ignore shits until the thing comes in.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Reactive MVC</h2>

<p>http://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom</p>

<ul>
<li>React inspired by reactive programming, ended up mix of interactive
and reactive patterns: TODO what is interactive?</li>
<li>If a change in <code>foo</code> affects <code>bar</code>, and <code>foo</code> is responsible for
telling <code>bar</code>, it&#8217;s interactive; reactive would be <code>bar</code> just
magically responding&#8230;</li>
<li>Interactive: &#8220;module X defines which others modules X affects&#8221;</li>
<li>Reactive: &#8220;module X defines which other modules affects X&#8221;

<ul>
<li>often implemented w EventEmitter (see below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Controllers are inherently interactive, so get rid of em</li>
<li>Models should export Observables, views should subscribe to model
events.</li>
<li>Fill the gap of controller:</li>
</ul>


<h2>EventEmitter</h2>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env node

var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;

var ee = new EventEmitter();

ee.on('wattles', function(foo) {
  console.log("received some serious wattles", foo);
});

console.log("numlisteners:", ee.listeners('wattles').length)

setTimeout(function() {
  ee.emit('wattles', 123);
}, 2000);
</code></pre>

<h2>Kefir.js</h2>

<p>http://pozadi.github.io/kefir/</p>

<p>FRP JS lib based on Bacon and Rx but focused on high perf, low mem
usage.</p>

<p>Like Bacon, it distinguishes b/w Properties and EventStreams.</p>

<h2>Cycle.js</h2>

<p>https://github.com/staltz/cycle</p>

<p>This framework is based on the seminal blog
http://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom</p>

<p>and these slides http://staltz.com/dont-react</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>I believe Cycle.js has no concept of a component. The idea that even a
little business / stateful logic lives in the component riles that guy&#8217;s
feathers, but components are crucial for simplifying the mental model
and easily packaging / reusing things. Seems that nuts hasn&#8217;t been
cracked in Cycle.js yet.</p>

<p>UPDATE: components are custom elements in cycle.js
https://github.com/staltz/cycle/blob/master/src/custom-elements.js</p>

<p>(There&#8217;s also unanswered questions about minimizing use of globals,
dependency injection, etc.)</p>

<p>It also seems pretty bad that there&#8217;s lots of examples of reaching in
and grabbing the <code>data-wat-id</code> out of the event target.</p>

<p>So it still seems pretty good that the job of a component is to
translate DOM events into component domain events. A DayCellComponent
in a calendar should translate click/tap events&#8230;</p>

<h2>Taps/Clicks, who&#8217;s responsible?</h2>

<p>Is it up to a component to discern b/w a tap and a click? Some other way
of using input stream?</p>

<p>In Ember we could do something like override &#8220; to mean
different things in different contexts, tap vs click (which I use).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty nice being able to do that; I guess in React you&#8217;d use
<code>withContext</code>?</p>

<p>This seems like a nice hookable thing for event delegation&#8230; oh wait it
already is in ember.</p>

<p>Maybe &#8220; should declare an input stream that you can hook into
n the component?</p>

<p>HERE IS a very concrete question I&#8217;d like to resolve:</p>

<p>Given:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a list of items</li>
<li>Selecting an item expands an item</li>
<li>Only one item can be expanded at a time</li>
<li>In a desktop setting, &#8220;selections&#8221; happen via clicks, in a mobile
setting, &#8220;selections&#8221; happen via taps</li>
</ul>


<p>You&#8217;ll probably model this with:</p>

<ul>
<li>a ListComponent</li>
<li>ItemComponents</li>
</ul>


<p>My beef (and TODO list):</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it make sense for <code>ItemComponent</code>s to attach their own event
listeners?

<ul>
<li>What if they just got a stream of input? That means something
outside could:

<ul>
<li>decide whether taps or clicks were to be used for selection,
and child components would just receive a selectionEventStream
that they could respond to

<ul>
<li>Hmmm, but given the constraint</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that iOS let&#8217;s you suspend/resume touch interactions in general:
http://iosdevelopertips.com/event-handling/suspend-touch-events.html
But I think we want something more granular.</p>

<p>There seems to be a tug of war between re-render everything and
streamify everything. E.g. you diff the data and get per item stream
updates of isExpanded streams&#8230; so that you can re-render only those
items&#8230;? What&#8217;s the goal of this?</p>

<p>If you have virtual dom and re-render all the time, then when you do
want streams?</p>

<ul>
<li>Business logic, series of queries, async, and updating properties
along the way. Maybe UI isn&#8217;t much of a place for streams?
Unless I can show that there is UI not elegantly handled by virtual
DOM, I should drop trying to force streams into UI somehow&#8230;</li>
<li>It still seems like there&#8217;s a place for it though in app state in
general, particularly in actions management.

<ul>
<li>In particular, I never want to have to set some isLoading flag every
again. I should never have to check timerIds and cancel them ever
again. I should never have a bunch of transient properties every
again. Actions should jump start some process and you can listen to
their completion. Everything else: virtual dom (and virtual dom
can/should depend on these properties that you expose). Virtual DOM
state is explicit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>OK WE ARE GETTING CLOSE: handlebars/htmlbars templates have the benefit
of declaring loud and clear which properties are depended on for
rendering. If any of those properties change, it amounts to an implicit
setState. Otherwise there&#8217;s no need to re-render (this is all still
implying that KVO exists in Ember somehow).</p>

<pre><code>dismissStream = timer(2000).map(() =&gt; false)
newActionStreams = ... something that fires when a new event starts
// newActionStreams = filter(UIevents, () =&gt; actionIsUnderway???)
postActionMessageStream = race(dismissStream, newActionStreams)
</code></pre>

<p>OK OK OK so what I want is a way to express</p>

<ul>
<li>progression of time in a template</li>
<li>current values, certain flags, etc, without setting boolean properties</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a stream of status on some complex multi-step async
process:</p>

<pre><code>observable = someUIEvent.flatMapLatest(some ajax with retries)
                        .followedBySomeOtherAsync
                        .followedBySomeOtherThing

// maybe...
observable = someUIEvent(someAjaxThing).flatMapLatest(some ajax with retries).state("stepOne")
                        .followedBySomeOtherAsync.state("stepTwo")
                        .followedBySomeOtherThing.state("stepThree")
</code></pre>

<p>There&#8217;s not really a nice mechanism for representing this in a
template without a lot of manual <code>.set</code>s. It&#8217;s like we want some kind of
switch statement?</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;h3&gt;Loading  items from server&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Here are all the step one things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Please select from the following options:&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;

        &lt;li &gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Does this make sense? Maybe we just want / need a switch statement in
general. This would also have to work with LiquidFire as well&#8230;</p>

<p>But what the above demonstates is:</p>

<ul>
<li>scoped properties linked to progressive states within an
observable/promises</li>
<li>no global/manual flag management</li>
<li>no timer ids to set and reset</li>
</ul>


<p>TODO:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just have to find the sweet spot with plugging this stuff into ember
in a way people prefer.</li>
<li>How to you go back to a previous &#8220;state&#8221;? What is a &#8220;state&#8221;? How do
people normally model state machines in rx?</li>
</ul>

<h2>React keys vs refs</h2>

<p>Clojure has a concept of refs (and similar concurrency primitives) to
add the concept of identity to a value that changes over time (given
that Clojure has immutable data types but still needs to synchronize
and share data b/w threads).</p>

<p>In React, you use keys to distinguish array values so that your
renders don&#8217;t do weird things; how would this work given immutable
datatypes?</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, if only the array changes but the items in that array are the
same, then you&#8217;re fine</li>
<li>But if, say, the selected item has modified, then the previous
reference is invalid/points to an older version of the thing</li>
</ul>


<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a sexy way we could handle this in ember&#8230; maintain a ref
to a changing value.</p>

<h2>Observables and Observables</h2>

<ul>
<li>Observable

<ul>
<li>changing values over time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Observer

<ul>
<li>consumes observers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Observables don&#8217;t do anything on their own until they&#8217;re consumed in
some way. SO WEIRD. But the following doesn&#8217;t do anything&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>var obs = Rx.Observable.return('wat').do(function(a) {
    console.log("do", a);
});
</code></pre>

<p>until you add</p>

<pre><code>function K() {}
obs.forEach(K);
obs.forEach(K);
</code></pre>

<p>So what I&#8217;d like is a statemachine with its own stream events, w auto
desubscribe/dispose/etc</p>

<pre><code>var defaultState = {
};

var defaultState = {
};

var states = {
  defaultState: {
  },

  editingItem: function() {
    // TODO: define streams/actions for leaving this state
    // tapping another item leaves it....
  },

  savingItem: {
  }
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Bacon state machine</h2>

<p>http://jsbin.com/qihabo/2/edit?html,js,console,output</p>

<pre><code>Bacon.fromArray([1,2,3]).withStateMachine(0, function(sum, e) {
   if (e.hasValue()) {
       return [sum + e.value(), []];
   } else if (e.isEnd()) {
       return [sum, [new Bacon.Next(function() { return sum; }), e]];
   } else {
       alert("asd")
       return [sum, []];
   }
}).log();
</code></pre>

<p>TL;DR it&#8217;s a state machine only for computing the next value of stream,
it&#8217;s not some implementation of a state machine or anything like that.</p>

<p>Could be useful in the rare cases where you can&#8217;t represent what you
want in the form of other stream operators.</p>

<h2>Sequences of Coincidence</h2>

<p>http://www.introtorx.com/Content/v1.0.10621.0/17_SequencesOfCoincidence.html#SequencesOfCoincidence</p>

<p>I think this is what I&#8217;ve been looking for; handling actions differently
if they occur within the &#8220;window&#8221; of another event, e.g. &#8220;handle these
actions if they happen while a given route is active (and the router is
stable / not loading transitions)&#8221;.</p>

<p>Buffers are conceptually grouped with window operators:</p>

<p>It converts a stream of values into a stream of buffered arrays of
values, buffered according to time, or some buffer size, or whatever.
In other words buffer takes <code>IObservable&lt;T&gt;</code> and returns
<code>IObservable&lt;IList&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code>source|-0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9|
result|-----0-----3-----6-9|
            1     4     7
            2     5     8
</code></pre>

<p>The analogy is that a window is open when Buffer receives first value,
and window closes when buffer&#8217;s full or time elapses.
Windows return <code>IObservable&lt;IObservable&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>So the subscribe handler of a window passes you the observable, rather
than the already flattened List that Buffer would give to you.</p>

<p>So in rxjs: http://jsbin.com/colora/3/edit</p>

<pre><code>var source = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 50)
  .window(function () { return Rx.Observable.timer(125); })
  .take(4)
  .flatMap(function (x) { return x.toArray(); });

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  function (x) {
    console.log('Next: ' + x);
  },
  function (err) {
    console.log('Error: ' + err);
  },
  function () {
    console.log('Completed');
  });
</code></pre>

<p>produces</p>

<pre><code>"Next: 0,1,2"
"Next: 3,4,5"
"Next: 6,7"
"Next: 8,9,10"
</code></pre>

<p>Why 6,7? Because the initial timer w 50ms period never stops firing:</p>

<pre><code>starting timer: 0----50---100--150--200--250--300--350--400--450--500--550--600--650
close timer:    0-----------125----------250---------375----------500
window1:        0    1     2 |
window2:                        3    4   5|
window3:                                       6   7  |
window4:                                                 8   9  10|
</code></pre>

<p>The 50ms period never stops firing and it&#8217;s on the third iteration where
because of the relative late start of the next period timer firing after
the beginning of the 125ms close interval, it can only get 2 events in
before the stream closes.</p>

<p>SO WTF do I want to do with this: something about windows for
currently active route states? Does that make sense?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s apparently a version that lets you overlap windows&#8230; why would
this be useful? I don&#8217;t know! And it doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s implemented
in RxJS, but the idea is you provide an observable that fires when a
window should be opened, and a close observer that runs for each new
window, so if your close fires at a larger interval than opens happen,
then you&#8217;ll have overlapping streams, which I guess means, say, a &#8220;3&#8221; or
&#8220;4&#8221; might be fired on multiple streams sprung up.</p>

<h2>RxJs Joins</h2>

<p>Note that all of this is part of the <code>coincidence</code> lib of Rx.</p>

<p>Join operator joins too sequence; zip is kind of a join, but zip is based
on index, and join does sequences.</p>

<p>zip accepts</p>

<ul>
<li>a &#8220;left&#8221; observable: each value produced opens another window</li>
<li>a &#8220;right&#8221; observable: produces values that pair open with the values
of left, while left stream is still open.</li>
<li>a &#8220;left duration&#8221; fn: returns an observable whose first value or
closing will close the left-generated observable (note: it doesn&#8217;t
even matter what type the closing value/observable is)</li>
</ul>


<p>So &#8220;right&#8221; values that start after &#8220;left&#8221; values will still be joined
with cached, previously opened windows. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>L 0-1-2-3-4-5-
</code></pre>

<p>plus</p>

<pre><code>R --A---B---C-
</code></pre>

<p>produces</p>

<pre><code>0, A
1, A
0, B
1, B
2, B
3, B
0, C
1, C
2, C
3, C
4, C
5, C
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now it seems fairly obvious that, if I immediately closed the window by returning Observable.Empty<Unit>, or perhaps Observable.Return(0), windows would never be opened thus no pairs would ever get produced. However, what could I do to make sure that these windows did not overlap- so that, once a second value was produced I would no longer see the first value? Well, if we returned the left sequence from the leftDurationSelector, that could do the trick. But wait, when we return the sequence left from the leftDurationSelector, it would try to create another subscription and that may introduce side effects. The quick answer to that is to Publish and RefCount the left sequence. If we do that, the results look more like this.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Rx the default is to always create a new subscription; it&#8217;s NOT like
a promise whereby a singleton promise has already started firing.
Solution: use Publish.</p>

<p>https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/publish.md</p>

<p>Publish allows for the sharing of subscriptions.</p>

<p>So my question is&#8230; does publishing on its own start its own
subscription? Naw, I think you need to call <code>connect</code> once you&#8217;ve added
all your subscribers.</p>

<p>http://jsbin.com/colora/6/edit</p>

<pre><code>var obs = Rx.Observable.return('wat').do(function(a) {
  console.log("do", a);
});

var p = obs.publish();

function K() {}
p.forEach(K);
p.forEach(K);gma


// uncomment this to actually fire side effects
//p.connect();
</code></pre>

<p>refCount is hard to describe&#8230;</p>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7509503/how-can-i-create-an-rx-observable-which-stops-publishing-events-when-the-last-ob/7510245#7510245</p>

<p>Publish as in pub sub&#8230; you want to stop consuming resources once
everyone&#8217;s stopped subscribing?</p>

<p>http://www.zerobugbuild.com/?p=144</p>

<p>Publish creates a hot subscription, refCount makes it close when
subscribers are zero.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t do <code>refCount</code>, you have to do <code>connect</code>. If you don&#8217;t do
<code>connect</code> or <code>refCount</code>, I think the subscription never gets activated,
or something? I still don&#8217;t get it&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway, back to join:</p>

<blockquote><p>The quick answer to that is to Publish and RefCount the left sequence. If we do that, the results look more like this:</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>left  |-0-1-2-3-4-5|
right |---A---B---C|
result|---1---3---5
          A   B   C
</code></pre>

<p>TL;DR once you start using right duration selector, you can implement
other operators.</p>

<h2>console.log printf</h2>

<p>Saw this in Rx docs: https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/timer.md</p>

<pre><code>console.log("wat %s", 3);
</code></pre>

<p>Prints &#8220;wat 3&#8221; (but jsbin&#8217;s console.log override is not smart enough to
substitute).</p>
