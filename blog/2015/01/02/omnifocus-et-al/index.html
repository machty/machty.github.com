<p>http://abcnews.go.com/Business/register-product-christmas/story?id=21348313</p>

<p>For software it probably makes more sense since they&#8217;ll have your name
on file to let you know of any major security updates / breaches and
what not, but often warranties don&#8217;t actually require registering a
product. It&#8217;s decently likely the company just wants to sell info to
marketers, making money off of you and subjecting you to spam.</p>

<h2>DirectInput vs XInput</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectInput#DirectInput_vs_XInput</p>

<p>Relevant because I just got a wireless gamepad that may or may not work
with Mac. Apparently Mac only supports DirectInput, but either way these
shits are Microsoft API for interacting with input, DirectInput being
the deprecated one, XInput being the new.</p>

<p>This is the most useless shit I could have blogged / reminded myself
about. Why do I do it?</p>

<h2>Insurance, carriers, etc</h2>

<p>What&#8217;s a carrier? What&#8217;s the relationship b/w carrier and, e.g.
BlueCross BlueShield? What&#8217;s a PPO?</p>

<p>http://www.ehealthinsurance.com/health-plans/ppo/</p>

<p>http://www.ehealthinsurance.com/health-plans/hmo/;</p>

<p>HMO: Health Maintenance Organization: broad network of healthcare
services; broader range of preventative care than something else. You
choose a Primary Care Physician, and they must refer you to specialists.</p>

<p>Managed care: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_care</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a US-only term describing a bunch of techniques to keep health care
costs down; incentives for physicians and patients alike, preventative
care, etc. Spurred on by HMO act of 1973</p>

<p>https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/vodold/mngdcare.htm</p>

<p>Managed care:</p>

<ul>
<li>explicit standards for selecting providers</li>
<li>formal programs for ongoing quality review / improvement</li>
<li>preventative care, keeping enrollees healthy to reduce use of services</li>
<li>financial incentives for enrollees to use providers and procedures
covered by the plan.</li>
</ul>


<p>Managed care integrates financing and delivery of health care services.
It is implemented/used/referenced by:</p>

<ul>
<li>HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations): provides wide range of services
for fixed, periodic payment (like monthly insurance payments)</li>
<li>PPOs (Preferred Provider Organizations): groups of hospitals,
physicians, etc., who contract with insurer, employer, 3rd party
admin, etc, to provide health care to all insured</li>
<li>POS plans (point of service): combo of HMO+PPO&#8230;?</li>
</ul>


<p>Features common to managed care:</p>

<ul>
<li>pre-authorization (let insurer know before you do some surgery, etc)</li>
<li>rigorous utilization review&#8230;?</li>
<li>emphasis on use of primary physicians (why? what does this offer?)</li>
</ul>


<p>OK I TAKE THIS ALL BACK this was a shitty little abstract to link to.</p>

<p>Indemnity:</p>

<ul>
<li>security or protection against a loss or other financial burden</li>
<li>security against or exception of legal responsibility of one&#8217;s actions</li>
<li>payment to victor of war as a condition for PEACE</li>
</ul>


<h2>Family Medicine</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_medicine</p>

<p>It means a physician for people of all ages.</p>

<h2>Quorum</h2>

<p>the minimum number of members of an assembly or society that must be present at
any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid.</p>

<p>e.g. House of Cards quorum.</p>

<h2>Random fucking World MasterCard benefits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Auto rental collision damage waiver

<ul>
<li>Must use applicable card for entire rental transaction</li>
<li>Decline rental company&#8217;s collision waiver</li>
<li>&#8220;For most cards, the coverage is secondary, meaning that if you have car insurance, you have to file a claim there first (and your premium may go up). But your credit card should step in and pick up where your auto insurer leaves off, paying the tab for your deductible, towing charges and other fees. However, as many frustrated cardholders have learned, the fine print can be tricky. Credit card companies have their own restrictions and exclusions and they, too, often refuse to pay some types of fees levied by car rental companies.&#8221;</li>
<li>If you <em>don&#8217;t</em> have primary insurance, you can use CDW as primary so
long as you have a notarized report at time of incident that you had
no insurance. Why notarized? Not just because Chase is a dick but
because people might not want to report to their primary insurance
because their rates will go up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>What&#8217;s a declaration page?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s info from the car insurance company summarizing benefits, which car
they apply to, which drivers, address of driver, summary of coverage,
liability limits.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Purchase protection</p>

<ul>
<li>Items purchased w card covered in case of theft, damage, accidental loss</li>
<li>Will replace/repair/reimburse up to $500 per claim, $50,000 per account</li>
<li>Secondary&#8230; if you have preexisting applicable insurance, that must come first</li>
<li>Not covered:

<ul>
<li>plants/animals, antiques, boats/cars/autos/motorized vehicles,
software, items purchased for resale, &#8220;mysteriously disappearing&#8221;
items (where no evidence of wrongful act), <em>items lost by common
carrier (like USPS)</em>, jewelry/watches stolen from non-carry-on
luggage, items lost from war/terrorism/rebellion/confiscation/earthquakes,
medical equipment, perishables/consumables/perfumes/cosmetics,
travelers checks/cash/tickets, <em>used/pre-owned items</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Needed for reimbursement:

<ul>
<li>claim form</li>
<li>copy of card receipt</li>
<li>copy of itemized store receipt</li>
<li>copy of police report (made within 48 hours of incident), or
whatever kind of report</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have personal/primary insurance:

<ul>
<li>You must use it (homeowner&#8217;s/renter&#8217;s/automabile), and the CC
company will cover any leftover deductible, or even the item
itself if you&#8217;ve exhausted the insurance.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Trip Cancellation/Interruption</p>

<ul>
<li>Trip cancellation is before the trip starts, interruption is during, derp</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Price Protection:</p>

<ul>
<li>e.g you buy something, and then a printed ad lists it for less, then
within 90 days of purchase you can make a claim and get reimbursed
the difference.</li>
<li>Pretty cool, too lazy to describe the fine print</li>

<h2>A skillet is a fucking frying pan</h2>

<p>And the difference between a fry(ing) pan/skillet and a saute pan is
that saute pans have 90 degree angle sides, where&#8217;s skillets are sloped.

<h2>Bacon.js</h2>

<ul>
<li>EventStream: distinct events that happen over time</li>
<li>Property: value that changes over time</li>
</ul>


<p>TODO: Why have both?</p>

<ul>
<li>EventStreams have no initial value</li>
</ul>


<p><code>combine</code>: basically map two streams/properties into a Property (why not
event stream? what&#8217;s the EventStream equivalent?). You can pass a method
name as the second arg and it&#8217;ll be called on the&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. In
the case of <code>.scan</code> it&#8217;s the accumulator. What makes sense for combine?
Proably on the first arg, but that&#8217;s weird. NO it&#8217;s not, it gets called
on the current property of course. Let&#8217;s test this theory.</p>

<p>Actually no this makes no sense, they have an example</p>

<pre><code>var out = a.combine(b, ".concat")
</code></pre>

<p>It makes sense that it&#8217;d use the current value of the output property to
call <code>.concat</code> on, such as an array, but <code>.concat</code> mutates the
underlying array&#8230; is that ok? Seems fucky, seems like someone who got
a previous value from <code>out</code>, array, might have their array value
mutated. Let&#8217;s find out why this would not be the case&#8230;</p>

<p>Fuck it too lazy right now.</p>

<p>Convert promise to EventStream: <code>Bacon.fromPromise</code>.</p>

<p>So, flat map exists whenever you&#8217;d like to map to some asynchronous
value where order can&#8217;t be preserved&#8230; so for instance if you had a
serialize of values and you wanted to map them to some other value that
could be determined synchronously, you&#8217;d just map, but if you can&#8217;t
return something synchronously, each &#8220;map&#8221; should essentially return a
new stream, case in point: AJAX-based auto-completes. You translate text
field updates into ajax queries, each of which have their own unique
async.</p>

<pre><code>textUpdate -&gt; map -&gt; map -&gt; mapToAjax
                                -&gt; ajax promise
                                -&gt; ajax promise
                                -&gt; ajax promise
</code></pre>

<p>Need to reconcile these back into a single stream.</p>

<p>The pattern is expand into async via ajax and coalesce back into values
with flatMap.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>flatMap</code>: does NOT preserve ordering</li>
<li><code>flatMapLatest</code>: discards/forgets previous values if new ones come
back first</li>
</ul>


<p>Question: is there a flatMap that preserves order without discarding?</p>

<p><code>fromBinder</code>: create your own custom stream. The callback accepts a
<code>sink</code> function which is how you emit events.</p>

<p>What does <code>sink</code> mean? I guess it means a consumer of a stream? Why the
stream sinks into.</p>

<p><code>interval</code> vs <code>fromPoll</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>interval</code> returns a stream that emits an optional value that you pass
to it.</li>
<li><p><code>fromPoll</code> has no concept of a value, it just runs your callback</p>

<p>  var stream = Bacon.fromBinder(function(sink) {</p>

<pre><code>sink([new Bacon.Next("2nd"), new Bacon.Next("3rd")])
sink(["4th", "5th"])
sink(["6th", new Bacon.Next("7th")])
sink([new Bacon.Next("8th"), "9th"])
return function() {
   // unsub functionality here, this one's a no-op
}
</code></pre>

<p>  })
  stream.log()</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>2nd
3rd
["4th", "5th"]
6th
7th
[b, "9th"]
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <code>Bacon.Next</code> to convert an array into sequentially emitted
values, rather than the value emitted being an array. It&#8217;s like a
flatten decided by the emitter?</p>

<p>Bus: https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js#bus</p>

<p>A Bus an an EventStream that you can push values into.
I think: <code>promise:defer::eventStream:bus</code>, except that Deferreds
don&#8217;t have the promise&#8217;s <code>.then</code> api whereas a Bus <em>is</em> an event stream
with the same event stream API, plus a <code>.push</code> method.</p>

<p>Properties have optional starting values.</p>

<p>If provided, <code>onValue</code> emits a value immediately, else it only updates
on the first thing.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>EventStream.toProperty()</code>: convert to property</li>
<li><code>Property.change()</code>: convert to event stream</li>
</ul>


<p><code>Bacon.update</code>: create Property from initial value, update value based
on multiple inputs.</p>

<p>INTERESTING. This is kinda what we&#8217;ve been talking about in Emberland.
EXCEPT that <code>Bacon.update</code> doesn&#8217;t expose the means of updating the
property, it just encapsulates all updates into a single property, and
you need to provide the write-able buses via some other mechanism.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> Property and EventStreams are both Observables. c/d?</p>

<h2>Synchronizing streams, Bacon.when</h2>

<p>You&#8217;d like to zip together streams into a single stream, but when do you
fire an event? When both have since fired? When only one? <code>Bacon.when</code>
to the rescue to disambiguate and let you decide!</p>

<pre><code>Bacon.when(seed
</code></pre>

<h2>Braindumpin</h2>

<p>http://baconjs.github.io/tutorials.html#content/tutorials/4_Building_Applications_Out_Of_Bacon</p>

<p>Goal: understand Ember action bubbling vs Flux dispatcher pattern among
other things, grand unifying FRP theory.</p>

<p>Mutable state is an oxymoron, it&#8217;s hard to reason about programs with
mutable data structures, hence React is nice because renders are
stateless, allowing functional/immutability patterns.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s more and more frowned upon to do</p>

<p>and allow <code>x-foo</code> to directly change <code>blah</code>, which in present-day/legacy
Ember style would flow the data back upward. The data-down-actions-up
approach would involve:</p>

<p>and <code>updateBlah</code> would perform the set. It&#8217;s really just moving the
<code>set</code> back up to the parent so in that way it might just seem like
needless indirection, but this allows:</p>

<ul>
<li>easier reasonability/testability</li>
<li>can override <code>updateBlah</code> to do whatever and asyncly update <code>value</code>,
after some validation. It&#8217;s reaaaally hard/awkward/annoying to sub out
the <code>set</code> behavior</li>
</ul>


<h2>Flux et al</h2>

<p>What are the core concepts?</p>

<pre><code>Views ---&gt; (actions) ----&gt; Dispatcher ---&gt; (registered callback) ---&gt; Stores -------+
Ʌ                                                                                   |
|                                                                                   V
+-- (Controller-Views "change" event handlers) ---- (Stores emit "change" events) --+
</code></pre>

<p>First off, a store is like what&#8217;s traditionally called a model; it has
app state and app logic. A store might directly represent a single model
(i.e. what might be called a UserStore might just be a User model in
other MVCs), but in general stores can represent many objects, scoped to
a particular domain of the application.</p>

<p>If you click a button in a component, it never directly invokes some
method on a store. Why? Because it would be hard to trace the
dependencies? Any new component could come along and start calling
methods on some random store? Yes, confirm, you don&#8217;t want to do that.
You want a message bus. The dispatcher is that bus.</p>

<pre><code>action ---&gt;
action ---&gt;
action ---&gt;---&gt; dispatcher
action ---&gt;
action ---&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So in your tests you can stub the dispatcher and assert that expected
methods were called on it. Easy peasy I guess? Doesn&#8217;t it mean
you&#8217;ll have some giant switch statement that&#8217;s gotta divvy out events in
the dispatcher? Often: yes, it does, which is desirable for small enough
stuff, issues with scalability though.</p>

<p>The dispatcher model does have the benefit of being able to intercept
events and filter/debounce/coalesce them; this would be a nice place to
ensure that a stray tap in the middle of a sideways transition in a
mobile app didn&#8217;t fire some event.</p>

<p>Anyway, calling action helper fns on a dispatcher doesn&#8217;t do anything if
stores haven&#8217;t subscribed to dispatcher events.</p>

<h2>Reflux</h2>

<p>https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs</p>

<p>Seems like an improvement; gets rid of the switch statements; makes
actions listenable; makes stores listenable in case some stores depend
on others (replaces <code>waitFor</code>)</p>

<p>The actions being listenable is good because it gets rid of stores
receiving ALL actions and having to selectively respond to them via big
switch statement matching by string name.</p>

<p>Actions are functors, you can call them directly and that passes through
the payload to everyone listening.</p>

<pre><code>var statusUpdate = Reflux.createAction();
statusUpdate(data); // Invokes the action statusUpdate
statusUpdate.triggerAsync(data); // same effect as above
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>var statusUpdate = Reflux.createAction({ sync: true });
statusUpdate(data); // Invokes the action statusUpdate SYNChronously
statusUpdate.trigger(data); // same effect as above
</code></pre>

<p>var Actions = Reflux.createActions([
  &#8220;statusUpdate&#8221;,

<p>There&#8217;s lots of features for async and converting an action into async
based on its children.</p>

<p>Blah blah blah back to other ideas:</p>

<p>So if you wanted to do something like Flux in Ember, you&#8217;d have to do
something like</p>

<p>TODO: https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs#joining-parallel-listeners-with-composed-listenables</p>

<p>So my whole better actions idea was so that you could quickly reason
about action state.</p>

<pre><code>var TopLevelComponent = Ember.Component.extend({

  // Better Actions API
  submitForm: action(function() {
    return ajaxPromise(whatever);
  })
});
</code></pre>

<p>This worked <em>ok</em> ish but was horrible for lists because it&#8217;s a
singleton.</p>

<p>Use case: TODO MVC with slow async deletes; additional deletes should be
prevented if animating out of this route. There is a loading spinner if
at least one item is being deleted. Version 1 lets you delete multiple
items at the same time, Version 2 prevents this.</p>

<p>My goals is that I want to see how stream composition can address the
actions problem. Got async actions? Don&#8217;t want them firing at the same
time? Debounce those shits, or flatmap latest. (TODO: what&#8217;s the stream
approach for letting a previous action finish first before starting
another one? I think the answer is flatMapFirst)</p>

<p>For the &#8220;additional deletes should be prevented if animating out&#8221;
requirement, there should be some concept of an EventStream that
dilineates the start and end of when a route is active. If you&#8217;re using
LiquidFire this should be after a route has finished transitioning in
and right before the route has started transitioning out
(animation-wise). The idea being that by default actions are filtered
through that window. But how do you do that?</p>

<p>You want a stream that only emits events per some predicate&#8230;</p>

<p>Actually this is probably a good use case for takeWhile&#8230; takeWhile
route is active. http://jsbin.com/tuzifo/2/edit</p>

<p>But given that we might have components already being displayed, but
we&#8217;re not ready to receive their actions, we need to figure out how to
hook them up&#8230;</p>

<p>So what the fuck does <code>&lt;button &gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
do?</p>

<pre><code>TopLevelComponent
  MidLevelComponent
    LeafComponent
      &lt;button &gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe components implicitly pass down an actions stream? And
route-driven components just get a decorated one from the router? And
then Liquid Fire could provide one for components rendered within an
outlet?</p>

<p>actually expands to</p>

<p>&#8230;?</p>

<p>What am I trying to accomplish here? I&#8217;m so lost.</p>

<p>TODO: replace bullshit with something more meaningful.</p>

<p>https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js#observable-zip</p>

<p>zip only fires when both streams produce a value, else
backpressure/buffering can occur. Difference between these two is that
back pressure occurs when consumers/sinks can&#8217;t consume fast enough;
buffering can occur for other reasons on the source side of things, e.g.
only one stream in zip is producing values and hence buffering up
values. This can be alleviated by choosing a different join pattern than
the zip default.</p>

<p>Use Bacon.when biaaatch.</p>

<h2>Blood pressure</h2>

<p>110/70. What&#8217;s it mean.</p>

<blockquote><p>If your blood pressure is 120/80, 120 represents systolic pressure, or the pressure of blood against artery walls when the heart beats. Eighty represents diastolic pressure, or the pressure between beats.</p></blockquote>

<p>So it&#8217;s like a max min range, pressure will be the highest in the middle
of a heart beat, lowest between.</p>

<p>Systolic = during heart beat. Diastolic = pressure between beats. High
systolic is generally more serious.</p>

<h2>Make no promises</h2>

<p>http://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/23/make-no-promises/</p>

<h2>Buses as an anti-pattern</h2>

<p>http://baconjs.github.io/tutorials.html#content/tutorials/4_Building_Applications_Out_Of_Bacon</p>

<pre><code>var shoppingCartBus = new Bacon.Bus()
$.ajax('/api/cart').done(cart =&gt; shoppingCartBus.push(cart))
...
shoppingCartBus.onValue(cart =&gt; renderCart(cart))
</code></pre>

<p>What happens if the ajax push occurs before the <code>onValue</code> is set? It&#8217;s
missed, nothing gets rendered. It&#8217;s the same as</p>

<pre><code>var wat = new Wat();
// ...
wat.foo = new Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>What if someone does something depending on <code>.foo</code> being present? Boom.</p>

<p>Solution: inject your dependencies. Pass in buses. Pass in your inputs.
Pass in your actions.</p>

<p>This is kinda fucky:</p>

<pre><code>function ShoppingCartView(cart) {
  return {
    cartView: ...
    removeItemStream: $('#shopping-cart').asEventStream('click', '.remove-item')
      .map(function(e) { return $(e.currentTarget).data('id') })
}
</code></pre>

<p>So creating a view not only just creates the view but also returns the
&#8220;outputs&#8221; of the view, e.g. the actions being emitted from the view.
But this causes cyclic dependencies because you want to pass in a cart
model which provides inputs to the view but you want to provide the
outputs of that view back to the model, but also avoid the temporal
construction issues.</p>

<h2>RX vs Bacon</h2>

<p>https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js#for-rxjs-users</p>

<p>Bacon offers EventStreams and Properties, subclasses of Observables,
whereas RxJS just has Observables. So how do current values work in RxJS
or do you always have to save it to some state?</p>

<h2>RX hot/cold observables</h2>

<p>https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted/creating.md#cold-vs-hot-observables</p>

<p>TODO read about this.</p>

<h2>Hemipenes</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemipenis</p>

<p>Snakes have two penises, or penes, called hemepenes. Only one is used.
It&#8217;s a spiky weird thing that bloats out when aroused. Other similarly
animals have them, like lizards. Sharks have two &#8220;penises&#8221; but they&#8217;re
called claspers.</p>
