<p>PR is priority, which is dynamic; a running process will get less and
less priority over time. NI is nice value; the fixed value that adds to
priority.</p>

<h2>Ruby mem</h2>

<p>http://samsaffron.com/archive/2014/04/08/ruby-2-1-garbage-collection-ready-for-production</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby tracks malloc&#8217;s</li>
<li>classically, every <code>RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT</code> bytes,</li>
</ul>


<p>Heaps</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby maintains heaps of RVALUES.</li>
<li>RVALUES are c union structs, variable size depending on x64, x32, etc,
that are low level representations of ruby objects</li>
<li>require &#8216;objspace&#8217; lets you access ObjectSpace, which exposes the
linked list of free Ruby objects.</li>
<li>RVALUES are collected and reused; mallocs only happen when you expand
beyong the RVALUE list.</li>
</ul>


<p>GC minor/major sweeps:</p>

<p>Flow is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>Object.allocate</code> (in the course of calling <code>new</code>)</p>

<ul>
<li>gimme a free RVALUE

<ul>
<li>if no free RVALUES, do a sweep</li>
<li>figure out along the way if it needs to be a major sweep</li>
<li>blah blah blah i don&#8217;t want to keep doing this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>major sweep: run when malloc limit is hit (used to be 8MB, now it&#8217;s a
moving target)</p>

<ul>
<li>so you can malloc a bunch of times but once you hit malloc limit
it&#8217;s time for a major GC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>minor: run whenever heap slots run out

<ul>
<li>presumably, if this doesn&#8217;t free up enough mem, a malloc needs to
happen? or maybe a malloc always happens, and the minor sweep frees
up things for a future allocation attempts? either seem fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

		<h2>DI, Clojure Components</h2>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cmHf_kt-Q</p>

<p>A component is an object (just like in OOP) that encapsulates some state
but really just tries to focus on behavior rather than the manipulation
of that internal state.</p>

<p>Types of Components:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>State Wrapper</p>

<ul>
<li>e.g. wrap a stateful connection to a database</li>
<li>e.g. open expensive connection object on create, kill on destroy

<ul>
<li><code>(defrecord DB [host conn])</code>

<ul>
<li>host and conn are meant to be private fields, but privacy
isn&#8217;t actually enforcible in clojure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public API

<ul>
<li><code>(defn query [db &amp; ...] (.doStatement (:conn db)))</code></li>
<li>these functions <em>do</em> access the conn and host fields; they&#8217;re
the &#8220;public methods&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Constructor

<ul>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to just use (and maybe shouldn&#8217;t use?) the
default defrecord constructor (e.g. ->DB)</li>
<li>Instead you should expose more convenient constructors that
are themselves side-effect less but return the record.</li>
<li>e.g. <code>(defn db [host] (map-&gt;DB {:host host}))</code></li>
<li>NOTE: <code>map-&gt;RECORDNAME</code> is something declared for you by
the <code>defrecord</code> macro, specifically <code>(declare ~(symbol (str 'map-&gt; gname))</code></li>
<li>Again, no side effects&#8230; a constructor just produces an object,
but that object still needs to be kicked into gear in some way,
let&#8217;s say, via:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lifeycle Protocol

<ul>
<li>Side effects!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>(defrecord DB [host conn]
  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]</p>

<pre><code>(assoc this   ;; returns new thing!!! don't just sideeffect the obj
  :conn (Driver/connect host)))
</code></pre>

  (stop [this]

<pre><code>(.stop conn)
this)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Service Wrapper</p>

<ul>
<li>a service like Email is initialized with, say, host and api-key,
but after that point, everyone just needs to pass args like
address and body to use it; that state is encapsulated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Domain Model</p>

<ul>
<li>some subset of functionality and represent as a component</li>
<li>as opposed to OOP where you&#8217;d have a Customer obj with both state
for a specific customer as well as methods to control behavior and
manipulate state, a <code>Customers</code> domain model is an aggregate of
behavioral operations.</li>
<li><p>behavioral dependencies are encapsulated together; a Customers
object depends on the db state wrapper and email service</p>

<p>(defrecord Customers [db email])</p>

<p>;; public api:
(defn notify [customers name message]
  (let [{:keys [db email]} customers</p>

<pre><code>    address (query db ... name)]
(send email address message)))
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Domain Model (cont.)</p>

<ul>
<li>fetches db and email dependencies from customers record&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230; queries address from db</li>
<li>&#8230; and uses the email service to send it to the customer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Constructing components</p>

<ul>
<li>make a <code>defn</code>, tell the name of the dependences with :keywords.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Associative injection

<ul>
<li>a system (container in Ember) is just a map</li>
<li>if you want to stub dependencies, just assoc those stubs

<ul>
<li>weakness: if you base these test systems off the live one,
if you add another component to the live one, you have to
remember to stub it out (hence isolated containers)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

		<h2>Definitive Ubuntu folder hierarchy</h2>

<p>https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview</p>

<pre><code>/bin is a place for most commonly used terminal commands, like ls, mount, rm, etc.

/boot contains files needed to start up the system, including the Linux kernel, a RAM disk image and bootloader configuration files.

/dev contains all device files, which are not regular files but instead refer to various hardware devices on the system, including hard drives.

/etc contains system-global configuration files, which affect the system's behavior for all users.

/home home sweet home, this is the place for users' home directories.

/lib contains very important dynamic libraries and kernel modules

/media is intended as a mount point for external devices, such as hard drives or removable media (floppies, CDs, DVDs).

/mnt is also a place for mount points, but dedicated specifically to "temporarily mounted" devices, such as network filesystems.

/opt can be used to store addition software for your system, which is not handled by the package manager.

/proc is a virtual filesystem that provides a mechanism for kernel to send information to processes.

/root is the superuser's home directory, not in /home/ to allow for booting the system even if /home/ is not available.

/sbin contains important administrative commands that should generally only be employed by the superuser.

/srv can contain data directories of services such as HTTP (/srv/www/) or FTP.

/sys is a virtual filesystem that can be accessed to set or obtain information about the kernel's view of the system.

/tmp is a place for temporary files used by applications.

/usr contains the majority of user utilities and applications, and partly replicates the root directory structure, containing for instance, among others, /usr/bin/ and /usr/lib.

/var is dedicated variable data that potentially changes rapidly; a notable directory it contains is /var/log where system log files are kept.
</code></pre>

<h2>init.d vs init</h2>

<p><code>init.d</code> is old-school SystemV style, wherein you have executable
scripts in <code>/etc/init.d</code> folder which have case statements matching
<code>reload</code>, <code>start</code>, etc, and doing some behavior based on that.</p>

<p><code>/etc/init</code> houses the newer Upstart format largely adopted by Ubuntu,
and within that you have a bunch of <code>.conf</code> files for managing daemons.</p>

<p>init.d / SystemV:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/nginx restart
</code></pre>

<p>upstart</p>

<pre><code>restart nginx 
# looks up /etc/init/nginx.conf
</code></pre>

<h2>Apple Store Wonkery</h2>

<p>Failed to upload the app, many times, provisioning profile and
certificate shit due to know laptop. Final error within Application
Loader was due to ITMS-4088 error, and was solved when 1) built
everything with fresh certificates / prov profs under machty and 2)
deployed via the other email account which shall not be publicly named
because security.</p>

<h2>File Dialog slowness on 2011 MBP Yosemite</h2>

<p>Just upgraded my 2011 MBP (w SSD drive) to Yosemite and notice a bug
that every time a file dialog closes, regardless of the app, and
regardless of whether a file was chosen or the user cancels, there is a
~15s hanging spinner until it unfreezes. This happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the view mode is anything other than Icon mode (e.g. for any list view), AND</li>
<li>there are audio/video files in the folder (e.g. mp3, aiff, mov)</li>
</ul>


<p>If there&#8217;s text only files, or even pdfs or dmgs or other things with
icons, it&#8217;s fine, but one audio/visual</p>

		<h2>flatMapObserver</h2>

<p>Whereas flatMap merges the elements of the observable returned from the
mapping fn, flatMapObserver subscribes to each event of the incoming
observable via a similar API to observers, but the return of each fn is
an observable that gets merged/flatMapped.</p>

<p>https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/flatmapobserver.md</p>

<p>NOTE: the observable returned from the onComplete handler does not
cause the generated stream to end; it&#8217;ll be merged with any (possibly
delayed) observables returned from onNext handler.</p>

<h2>State</h2>

<p>State a la Clojure/immutability separates value from
identity, value is a consistent concept over time, and once two values
are equal, they&#8217;re equal forever, because nothing is mutable.</p>

<p>So, what about app state where event handlers are set up? Say you&#8217;ve
done the functional/React-y thing and you have some leaf component that
fires an event into the ethos at some point in time, and you&#8217;ve fluxed
it into some event handler that <code>setState</code>s at the root level. This
event could happen after 10 seconds, 1000 seconds, or possibly
immediately. But if it&#8217;s immediately, is this fundamentally different
from a situation where things are <em>not</em> data down actions up? How is
this different from a two way binding with async settling?</p>

<p>&#8220;how and why to avoid nil&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;d watched this before, but the last approach is most interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>embrace immutability</li>
<li>embrace domain objects whose non-nullable properties are part of
their identity</li>
</ul>


<p>Other thoughts:</p>

<p>Block-less <code>it</code> rspec specs are considered pending; useful for writing
out a bunch of specifications at once and implementing them later.</p>

<p>&#8220;pushing complexity down&#8221;</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re writing a test whose behavior depends on dependencies (e.g.
MonthlyBilling class pushes the &#8220;who-to-charge&#8221; logic into the User
classes&#8217;s <code>charge</code> method), you&#8217;re writing a &#8220;systems test&#8221; /

		<h2>More on Rx state machines</h2>

<p>From https://github.com/logicalguess/rx-state-machine</p>

<pre><code>// Pattern:
// 1. start off with initial door state, 
// 2. scan the UI event stream with a initial door state and a
//    transforming function. The transforming function is the thing
//    that runs the UI event on the current state, and returns the next state.
//    In this case the transforming fn is `transition`.
events.scan(door, transition).map(doorStatus)
    .subscribe(function (value) {
        view.render(value);
    });
</code></pre>

<p>So what I want to do is expose an API where you can group related events
into states, possibly share events between states, get an actions stream,
and&#8230; somehow transition elsewhere after that?</p>

<pre><code>var state = {
  submitForm: function() {
    // this is just a normal callback handler, just like actions api
  },

  // but maybe if you decorate your handler in some way...
  $submitForm: function(stream) {
    // ... you get a stream of actions instead
    // What should this API look like? How to export another stream
    // or property? 
    // Goals:
    // - make it easy/possible to
    //   - derive flag/state from action progress
    //   - 
  }
};

&lt;form &gt;
  &lt;SubmitButton action='submitForm'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Harness</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever grokked the word &#8220;harness&#8221; in a computer science
context.</p>

<blockquote><p>a set of straps and fittings by which a horse or other draft animal is fastened to a cart, plow, etc., and is controlled by its driver.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, a horse harness, wrapped around a horse to control it. Or a
parachute harness that wraps around a person to levitate them. Or a
child-restraining harness.</p>

<pre><code>so in this case, it takes a compiled ember CLI app that can normally run by itself, adds some bootstrap code, and runs it in a different environment

wrapper is maybe a synonym

but with slightly different connotations

I think of a harness as "holding the software in place" so you can make modifications to it, then run it

whereas wrapper implies you're trying to hide the underlying software
</code></pre>

<p>So put the otherwise self-contained / self-sufficient software in a
harness so you can run a bunch of tests on it, run it in a different
environment.</p>

		<h2>More actions shit</h2>

<p>Scenario: mobile app, I have a back button, I don&#8217;t want it to cause
another transition if the app is in mid-transition.</p>

<p>Mid-transition means:</p>

<ul>
<li>data has already started loading for a target route, or</li>
<li>some animation is underway, e.g. liquid fire</li>
</ul>


<p>Present day Ember:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>willTransition</code> hook to check some &#8220;isTransitioning&#8221; state (which you
have to remember to properly set and unset (though ember could/should
probably provide this for you))</li>
<li>some other router reopen hook, override transitionTo behavior. Pretty
crappy.</li>
</ul>


<p>React w react-router:</p>

<pre><code>Router.run(routes, function (Handler) {
  // custom data-loading logic, construct your own chain of promises
  // ...
  // maybe use flatMapLatest so that you're only responding to the
  // most recent transition, and then eventually:
  // React.render(&lt;Handler/&gt;, document.body);

  // this could be modeled by a stream 
});
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm so I want to be able to push values into a stream (let&#8217;s call it raw
stream), but have it only come out the other side if some other&#8230;
stream? predicate? allows it.</p>

<h2>Rx/Bacon Diagrams</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bacon: <code>flatMapConcat</code> (or <code>flatMapWithConcurrencyLimit(1)</code>)</li>
<li>Rx: <code>concatAll</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Flatten, preserve order of previously started streams (buffers later streams)</p>

<pre><code>...{1}
......{2........3}
.........{}
............{4}
{...1..2........3.4}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Bacon: <code>flatMap</code> (or <code>flatMapWithConcurrencyLimit(infinity)</code>)</li>
<li>Rx: <code>mergeAll</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Flatten, don&#8217;t preserve order (no buffering). (limiting concurrency
means buffering).</p>

<pre><code>...{1}
......{2........3}
.........{}
............{4}

produces
{...1..2.....4..3}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Bacon: <code>flatMapLatest</code></li>
<li>Rx: <code>switchLatest</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Flatten, unsubscribe from previous streams, RIGHT when the new stream
begins, not on its first value!</p>

<pre><code>...{1}
......{2........3}
............{4}

produces
{...1..2.....4}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>...{1}
......{2........3}
............{.........4}

produces
{...1..2.....4}
</code></pre>

<p>Observables are lazy. You can build a giant nested logical chunk of
observable but nothing happens until, say, a <code>forEach</code> subscribes to the
result of an observable that all the internal logic kicks into place.
Not true for promises (unless someone implements a lazy thennable).</p>

<p>TODO: hot vs cold observables distinction? does this exist in bacon?</p>

<p>This is how the <code>retry</code> operator works&#8230; in the same way you can call
<code>forEach</code> N times on an observable and kick start all the internal
logic/event handlers, retry will internally do this until it gets a
non-error response.</p>

<p>This is unless promises, which have the <code>.then</code> operator:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regardless of whether you call <code>.then</code>, the promise logic has already started</li>
<li>Calling <code>.then</code> at the same time just subscribes to the single,
already running promise, and <code>.then</code> on an already resolved promise
just returns that.</li>
</ul>

			Everything and Nothin</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Indemnity</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indemnity</p>

<p>Where indemnitor A pays B a sum of money to cover losses suffered by B
(regardless of whether A caused/was responsible for the loss).
Car insurance is an example. Life insurance is not, since the payout is
not based on any &#8220;valuation&#8221; of the life..</p>

<p>HMOs basically get involved with health care options to try and secure
efficient/cheap means of good healthcare, rather than traditional
indemnity insurance, which would, uhh, just pay out after the fact and
not get involved beforehand?</p>

<h2>HMO act of 1973</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Maintenance_Organization_Act_of_1973</p>

<ul>
<li>signed by nixon</li>
<li>intended to curb medical inflation</li>
<li>provided grants/loans to start an HMO, removed certain state
restrictions for federally qualified HMOs</li>
<li>required employers w 25+ employees to offer federally certified HMO
options <em>if</em> the employer was already offering traditional insurance</li>
<li>did NOT require employers to offer health insurance</li>
<li>established/solidied the term HMO</li>
</ul>


<h2>Humble Bundle</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble_Bundle</p>

<p>Series of collections (bundles) of digital thingers, often games,
distributed via pay-what-you-want. The more you pay, the more that&#8217;s
opened up. Configurable, but most pay goes to developers, some to
charity, some to Humble.</p>

<h2>What is JLD in Empire Blue?</h2>

<p>JLD is a network code representing the Pathway Enhanced network of
doctors, pharmaceuticals, etc.</p>

<p>The ID number on the card is network + member ID.</p>

<p>1-866-755-2680 Tech support for the website.</p>

<p>Even though they don&#8217;t put it on the card this year, my co-pay is $30,
which I always pay. After I blast through deductible, co-insurance kicks
in. But preventative visits to PCP are freeeeee. But if it&#8217;s not
preventative, the doctor will submit it to insurance as a different
code, which I have to pay for out of deductible. Otherwise shit is
freeeee.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the difference between Empire and Anthem?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s Empire BlueCross BlueShield and Anthem BlueCross BlueShield?</p>

<p>OK OK OK BlueCross BlueShield is a federation (bigass organization where
smaller groups have decent autonomy). Was originally Blue Cross in 1929,
and a separate Blue Shield in 1948, and they merged in 1982.</p>

<p>Anthem is their only publicly traded company, and within New York they
operate as &#8220;Empire&#8221; BlueCross. Jesus Christ these companies are too
fucking huge.</p>

<ul>
<li>Blue Cross Blue Shield

<ul>
<li>Anthem (publicly traded)

<ul>
<li>Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield (operates out of New York)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Difference b/w renter&#8217;s and home owner&#8217;s insurance</h2>

<p>http://coverhound.com/insurance-learning-center/homeowners-vs-renters-insurance-a-big-difference</p>

<ul>
<li>Renters

<ul>
<li>You insure belongings, not the building</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Homeowners

<ul>
<li>You insure the building, and the belongings

<ul>
<li>Hence it&#8217;s way more expensive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Insurance is often mandatory if you have a mortgage, but probably
not legally required if you straight up own the whole thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

		<h2>OmniFocus</h2>

<ul>
<li>Quick action add: ctrl+option+space</li>
<li>Send to inbox: Ctrl+F6

<ul>
<li>Note this is a Service that some reason not all apps implement?
But it works in Chrome so I think we&#8217;re good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you assign an inbox item to a project, it&#8217;s removed from the project</li>
<li>Someday maybe:

<ul>
<li>Put in single action project, mark project as on hold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So projects can have an On Hold status&#8230; but there&#8217;s also a waiting context?

<ul>
<li>Ah, both projects and contexts can choose what status they are&#8230;
from the same list of possible statuses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the repeat work? &#8220;1 week&#8221;? Why does it say multiple values?

<ul>
<li>Ah I should probably do this one at a time. The way it works is once
you complete, it&#8217;ll immediately schedule another one.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;The Expression Problem is a new name for an old problem. The
goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases
to the datatype and new functions over the datatype, without
recompiling existing code, and while retaining static type safety
(e.g., no casts).&#8221;</li>
<li>Java requires these to be declared up front, suffers</li>
<li>Why the &#8220;expression&#8221; problem? &#8216;The label &#8220;Expression Problem&#8221; puns on expression = &#8220;how much can your language express&#8221; and expression = &#8220;the terms you are trying to represent are language expressions&#8221;.&#8217;</li>
