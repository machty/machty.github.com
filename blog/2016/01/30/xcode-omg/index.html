<p>So many icons to prepare that I&#8217;m losing track of which devices are
which and when they came out:</p>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/a/26085718/914123</p>

<ul>
<li>1x images are for the original iPhone through the 3GS - &#8216;standard&#8217; resolution devices (3.5&#8221; screens)</li>
<li><p>2x images are for the iPhone 4 and 4S (3.5&#8221; Retina screens) and are also used for the iPhone 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Retina 4 2x are for the iPhone 5 and 5s (4&#8221; Retina screens)</p></li>
<li><p>2x, iPhone 5</p></li>
<li><p>3x, 5.5&#8221;, super-retina</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus (released Sep14)</li>
<li>iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus (released Sep15)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_6S#Timeline_of_models</p>

<p>Blah blah blah none of this is important. The rule is that Apple
specifies dimensions via pts, not pixels. Original iPhone was 1 to 1.
Then retina came out and on retina devices 1 pt is 2 px. And on triple
retina 1pt is 3px.</p>

<p>When Apple says &#8220;gimme a 60pt icon at 3x&#8221; they want a 180x180 pixel
image.</p>

<h2>transducer CSP buffer</h2>

<p>Why doesn&#8217;t js-csp allow unbuffered channels + transducers?</p>

<p>https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp/issues/7#issuecomment-57937657</p>

<blockquote><p>The main issue is that a transducer takes one value, but it may put any number of values into the channel. There is no guarantee that you&#8217;ll only get one.</p></blockquote>

<p>core.async apparently expands buffers sometimes (for &#8220;expanding&#8221;
transducers like cat). But js-csp is punting on unbuffered transducers.</p>

<h2>how does trello sync an update?</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re adding a trello card. You type &#8220;wat&#8221;
into a new card and press enter. Boom. Card created; anyone
else looking at the board will see it too.</p>

<p>How does this work under the hood?</p>

<p>It uses AJAX and two Websocket receives.</p>

<h3>AJAX POST: https://trello.com/1/cards</h3>

<p>In typical rest fashion it POSTs to https://trello.com/1/cards
to create a card. Relevant request payload:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "closed": false,

    // epoch milliseconds time. Corresponds to 2016-04-06 17:02:17 -0400
    "dateLastActivity": 1459976537279,

    // list of labels (no labels applied)
    "idLabels": [],

    // the Trello board we're adding to;
    // this is also the idModelChannel from the WebSockets
    // subscription that identifies the channel that we're subscribed to
    "idBoard": "50b2217de9adebf92a003faa",

    // the specific list we're adding the card to
    "idList": "56f0661ab54cf7e17a3403f4",

    // i don't know what this is
    "idMembers": [],

    // name of card (what i just typed in -- separate from description)
    "name": "wat",

    // probably used for ordering cards?
    "pos": 262143,

    // probably an authentication token since Trello doesn't
    // seem to use any auth headers
    "token": "&lt;redacted&gt;"
}
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s the request. Here&#8217;s the response</p>

<pre><code>{
    "badges": { /* numbers for varios badges */ },

    // time of creation
    "dateLastActivity": "2016-04-06T21:02:17.626Z",

    // blank description because I only provided the title
    "desc": "",
    "descData": { "emoji": {}
    },
    "due": null,

    // an email address that, when you send stuff to it,
    // posts the email contents as a comment
    "email": "&lt;redacted&gt;",
    "id": "57057959d3730256d4a5391b",
    "idAttachmentCover": null,
    "idBoard": "50b2217de9adebf92a003faa",
    "idChecklists": [],
    "idLabels": [],
    "idList": "56f0661ab54cf7e17a3403f4",
    "idMembers": [],
    "idShort": 296,
    "labels": [],
    "manualCoverAttachment": false,
    "name": "wat",
    "pos": 262143,
    "shortUrl": "https://trello.com/c/7iBjP7iY",
    "stickers": [],
    "url": "https://trello.com/c/7iBjP7iY/296-wat"
}
</code></pre>

<p>The the first weird thing about this is that this seems like
a pretty full payload of data, which is likely redundant to
any data received from the WebSocket. Speaking of which,
what does the WebSocket get? It seems to get two messages (and
at no point does it send anything):</p>

<pre><code>{
    "idModelChannel": "50b2217de9adebf92a003faa",
    "ixLastUpdateChannel": 5,
    "notify": {
        "deltas": [ /* giant blob of data... see below */ ],
        "event": "updateModels",
        "tags": [ "allActions", "clientActions" ],
        "typeName": "Action"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>First of note is the idModelChannel, which has the same value as
idBoard. This tells us what websocket &#8220;channel&#8221; this message corresponds
to: the channel for all updates that fall under the particular board
you&#8217;re looking at. This makes sense: when you look at another board
you should be subscribed to that board, and when you change which board
you&#8217;re looking at, you probably want to desubscribe from the old and
subscribe to the new.</p>

<p>This is the challenging thing about rolling your own synchronization
scheme: you have to define upfront your level of granularity of updates.
Trello has opted for the simple solution of:</p>

<ol>
<li>you subscribe to a single websockets connection</li>
<li>using that connection, you only subscribe to only one channel &#8211; the one
corresponding to the Trello board.</li>
<li>this implies that Trello&#8217;s server code is implemented such that any
changes to any submodels of Board (cards, card lists, etc) need
to notify the root board model of changes. Usually it&#8217;s pretty
messy when models have to notify their relationships of changes,
but since there&#8217;s just one root &#8220;observer&#8221;, the Trello Board model,
Trello&#8217;s probably avoided lots of ugly spaghetti code from models
having to notify each other of changes.</li>
</ol>


<p>So anyway, let&#8217;s get back to the websocket message above:</p>

<p><code>ixLastUpdateChannel</code> seems to just be a sequence number for a
particular websocket message. It is shared between tabs, such that
if Trello sends a WS message with the same <code>ixLastUpdateChannel</code>,
you can bet that the contents are the same. Let&#8217;s see if it&#8217;s the
same between users: YES even between different users is this stuff
shared. This implies another simplification that Trello can take
advantage of: because they don&#8217;t see to have ACLs or any other access
control, they can share a lot more information and maintain a lot
less subscription state on the server to keep everyone in sync.</p>

<p><code>notify</code> just seems to contain the payload of what has changed.
<code>event</code> always seems to have the value &#8220;updateModels&#8221;, so we
can ignore that. <code>tags</code> is &#8220;allActions&#8221; and &#8220;clientActions&#8221;&#8230; I&#8217;m
guessing this is provided as a means to filter, on the client-side,
what messages you want to respond to, so for instance, if you&#8217;re
building an adminstrative app and you want to show a page that
only responds to changes made from the admin app, you ignore
messages tagged as &#8220;clientActions&#8221; which presumably are actions
originating from the main Trello page that Trello customer use
(this is me just guessing, I have no idea).</p>

<p><code>typeName</code>, in my tests, has any of the following values:
&#8220;Action&#8221;, &#8220;Card&#8221;, or &#8220;Member&#8221;. It seems to describe which kind
of model has been updated. If it&#8217;s &#8220;Action&#8221;, then it probably
corresponds to the activity feed on the right side of the page
that shows recent modifications to the board. If it&#8217;s a &#8220;Card&#8221;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see
if it is shared between totally different users.</p>

<h2>IPsec</h2>

<p>Security at the Internet layer (rather than TLS at the application layer). So you can secure applications at the IP layer. VPN is an example of this.</p>

<p>  • IPsec can be host to host, host to security gateway, or sec gway to sec gway (i.e. network to network)</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TouDblq-sso</p>

<p>  • IPsec is type of VPN
  • VPN
  ⁃ enableable on home router
  ⁃ P2P connections
  ⁃ remote VPNs: central corporation sets up VPN, other things VPN into it
  • VPNs from 90s
  • in 90s, offices had central offices and regional offices
  • Secure tunnel over public network
  ⁃ Client to firewall
  ⁃ Router to router
  ⁃ Firewall to firewall
  • Instead of private hardware lines (which are tappable) just use public network
  • VPN Protocols
  ⁃ NOTE: link layer == layer 2. The layer where adjacent network nodes transfer data. TCP is between N number nodes, link layer concerns are physical connections between two nodes. Data link protocols concern only that segment between two nodes.
  ⁃ PPTP (point-to-point tunneling protocol)
  ⁃ from Microsoft
  ⁃ secured dialup in early days
  ⁃ happens on the data link layer
  ⁃ L2F (layer 2 forwarding protocol)
  ⁃ from Cisco
  ⁃ link layer
  ⁃ almost same as PPTP
  ⁃ L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)
  ⁃ Combines above 2. Note the combined names
  ⁃ IPsec (Internet Protocol security)
  ⁃ IETF open standard for VPN standards
  ⁃ operates on Network/Internet layer
  ⁃ commonly implemented on routers
  • IPsec
  ⁃ Layer 3 (IP/Networking layer)
  ⁃ Everyone uses IP datagrams, you get it for free.
  ⁃ Protects node<->node, router<->router, whatever<->whatever
  ⁃ Two modes of operation
  ⁃ Tunnel
  ⁃ Transport
  ⁃ IPsec combines following components (hence it&#8217;s called a &#8220;protocol suite&#8221;)
  ⁃ Security Associations (SA)
  ⁃ Authentication headers (AH)
  ⁃ Encapsulating security payload (ESP)
  ⁃ Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
  ⁃ Another component: ISAKMP
  ⁃ Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol
  ⁃ TODO: Wat
  ⁃ IP Internet Protocol is not secure
  ⁃ IPsec built into IPv6 protocol (really?)
  ⁃ IPsec not in IPv4 because 4 was developed in old times when security wasn&#8217;t such an issue
  ⁃ Security issues w IPv4
  ⁃ Source spoofing
  ⁃ replay packets
  ⁃ no data integrity or confidentiality
  ⁃ All of above addressed in IPsec
  ⁃ RC 4301 &#8220;The IP Sec Architecture&#8221;&#8230; defines elements of AH and ESP
  ⁃ RFC 4302
  ⁃ Algorithm independent RFC for exportable crypto auth
  ⁃ AH doesn&#8217;t have any encryption mechanisms
  ⁃ RFC 4304
  ⁃ ESP: Encapsulating Security Payload
  ⁃ Adds encryption to ipv4 and v6 packets
  ⁃ RFC 2408
  ⁃ ISAKMP: procedures / packet formats for modifying security associations
  ⁃ Transferring key auth data b/w two endpoints
  • Benefits of IPsec
  ⁃ Confidentiality
  ⁃ by encrypting data
  ⁃ available only to limited num of people
  ⁃ access lists, etc
  ⁃ no man in middle reading
  ⁃ Integrity
  ⁃ Routers at each end check hash/checksum
  ⁃ Authentication (confirm who you are)
  ⁃ Signatures and certs
  ⁃ Compatibility through existing IP networks at Layer 3. Transparent to applications. Hence applications don&#8217;t have to know about IPsec.
  ⁃ Anti-replay
  ⁃ Key management
  ⁃ No way to lose a key
  ⁃ Ways to recover (?) keys
  • IPsec modes
  ⁃ Great image at https://youtu.be/TouDblq-sso?t=1461
  ⁃ Tunnel
  ⁃ Entire IP packet is encrypted/encapsulated, becomes datacomponent of new (and larger) IP packet
  ⁃ Frequently used in IPsec site-to-site VPN
  ⁃ Encapsulated packet has its own source/destination
  ⁃ Quite useful for implementing Point to Point, site to site VPN.
  ⁃ Frequently used in P2P&#8230; WHY?
  ⁃ So if you&#8217;re trying to tie two networks to each other, then if you&#8217;re 192.168.1.2 and you&#8217;re trying to reach 192.168.1.3, then at the IP layer it can use Tunnel mode to wrap your packet so that source and destination reflect your real external IP source/dest, but the encrypted IPsec contents get used post VPN termination to route to private IP.
  ⁃ Example:
  ⁃ before: [IP[TCP[Payload]]]
  ⁃ i.e. IP header + TCP/UDP + payload
  ⁃ after: [IPsec[encrypted(IP[TCP[Payload]])]]
  ⁃ payload becomes (IP header + TCP/UDP + payload). prefixed w ipsec header
  ⁃ Useful for site-to-site
  ⁃ New source and dest in header
  ⁃ Because of this, used in P2P&#8230; (?)
  ⁃ From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Modes_of_operation
  ⁃ entire IP packet encrypted/auth&#8217;d. Encapsulated into new IP packet.
  ⁃ NAT traversal supported presumably because old IP header preserved
  ⁃ NOTE:
  ⁃ Tunneling in general just means repackaging the data sent so that it can &#8220;fit&#8221; within another kind of network.
  ⁃ e.g. running ipv6 over ipv4, remotely connecting to VPN, etc
  ⁃ Transport
  ⁃ No new packet created
  ⁃ Just insert IP header&#8230; but somehow preserve size?
  ⁃ [IP[IPsec[TCP[Payload]]]
  ⁃ frequently used for remote access to VPNs
  ⁃ logging into corporate VPN, etc
  ⁃ probably because you don&#8217;t bloat header too much?
  ⁃ But what about NAT????
  ⁃ From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Modes_of_operation
  ⁃ only payload of IP packet is encrypted/auth&#8217;d
  ⁃ routing (IP header) is untouched
  ⁃ if AH is used, IP addresses can&#8217;t be NATd, or hash will be invalidated.
  • IPsec component review
  ⁃ Security protocols
  ⁃ AH
  ⁃ ESP
  ⁃ Establishing the tunnel
  ⁃ IKE
  • Security Associations (SA)
  ⁃ Used by all other protocols
  ⁃ A collection of different attributes/parameters associated w secure connections
  ⁃ If you have IPsec datagram, when it arrives at other interface, which set of params to use?
  ⁃ Hosts can be connected to many different connections/conversations going on
  ⁃ Each connection has different set of keys/algos
  ⁃ An SA has 3 params
  ⁃ SPI: security parameter index
  ⁃ IP destination address
  ⁃ SADB (SA database)
  ⁃ SA is unidirectional
  ⁃ Two SAs required for bi-directional communication b/w two endpoints
  ⁃ A single SA can be used for AH or ESP, but not both
  ⁃ hence: if you want to use AH and ESP for bi-directional, you need total of 4 SAs
  ⁃ When a system sends a packet that requires IPsec, server will look up SA in SADB
  • Setting up SA
  ⁃ Manual keying
  ⁃ Configure each node
  ⁃ Automatically
  ⁃ Using IKE (Internet Key Exchange)
  • ISAKMP (RFC 2408)
  ⁃ Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol
  ⁃ Many different SAs being passed forwards and backwards, this protocol helps manage it
  ⁃ Distinct from key exchange, focuses only on key management
  ⁃ Many different key exchange protocols, but ISAKMP is used to negotiate what you&#8217;re using so that the protocols can do the rest
  • Authentication Header (AH)
  ⁃ Security Protocol, along with ESP; both offer authentication and integrity.
  ⁃ Typically use only AH or ESP, not both, but if both, AH comes after ESP
  ⁃ ESP is far more popular today&#8230; AH not even supported in Cisco
  ⁃ AH authenticates/integrities but doesn&#8217;t encrypt IP traffic.
  ⁃ ESP encrypts
  ⁃ ESP/AH are 50/51 in IANA protocol numbers. This number is sent in IP packet header under &#8220;protocol&#8221;
  • ESP
  ⁃ Must encrypt and auth per packet
  ⁃ Encrypt first and then auth
  • AH for Transport Mode
  ⁃ before: [original IP][TCP/UDP][Data]
  ⁃ after: [original IP][AH Header][TCP/UDP][Data]
  ⁃ AH header authenticates everything except for mutable IP header fields
  ⁃ Hop-to-hop fields are mutable
  ⁃ Why use it?
  ⁃ You wouldn&#8217;t if you need encryption
  ⁃ but AH is less bandwidth
  • ESP for transport mode
  ⁃ https://youtu.be/TouDblq-sso?t=2185
  ⁃ adds a header and trailer
  ⁃ TCP payload + ESP trailer is encrypted
  ⁃ encrypted result and ESP header is authenticated
  ⁃ ESP authentication comes at the very end
  • Tunnel mode means bigger packets due to headers/trailers/etc
  ⁃ You might need to talk to network providers to increase MTU sizes (presently 1500 bytes in most cases)
  • Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
  ⁃ automated
  ⁃ Modes
  ⁃ Main Mode
  ⁃ 3 exchanges of info between IPsec peers
  ⁃ when connecting, 1 peer (initiator) sends one or more proposals to other peer (responder). Responder selects proposal.
  ⁃ proposal can indicate whether initiator supports Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
  ⁃ ensures that a session key remains secure even if one of the PKs to derive session key has been compromised. Jesus Christ.
  ⁃ mainly used for first phase
  ⁃ Aggressive Mode
  ⁃ Used during phase 1
  ⁃ Same thing as main mode but with fewer packets (3)
  ⁃ Quick Mode
  ⁃ Negotiates params for IPsec session in Phase 2.
  ⁃ Phases
  ⁃ Phase 1
  ⁃ Establish secure channel (ISAKMP SA) between two endpoints
  ⁃ Use either main mode/aggressive mode
  ⁃ Authenticate computer id using certs or pre-shared secret
  ⁃ Idea behind this:
  ⁃ each application will have its own security policy. e.g. VPNs, or p2p, etc
  ⁃ Phase 2
  ⁃ Establish secure channel between computers intended for transmit of data
  ⁃ Using quick mode
  ⁃ Review
  ⁃ Two endpoints (terminals)
  ⁃ Phase 1: secure channel
  ⁃ Negotiate ISALMP SA which will create IPsec SAs
  ⁃ Step 1: SA negotiation (encryption, hash, auth, DF group)
  ⁃ Do Diffie Hellman exchange
  ⁃ two computers generate shared priv key using prime numbers, modulos, exponents, and holy fuck.
  ⁃ TL;DR, this derives a shared K that is roughly as secure as RSA. Fucking awesome.
  ⁃ Provide auth information
  ⁃ Authenticate the peer</p>
