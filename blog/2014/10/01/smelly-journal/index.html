	<h2 class="title">Smelly Journal</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><h2>TCP/UDP/Sockets/wat</h2>

<p>What&#8217;s a socket?  Depends on who you ask.</p>

<p>The <a href="file:///Users/machty/code/machty.github.com/rfc793.html">TCP RFC</a>
defines a &#8220;socket&#8221; as an IP address (supplied in IP packet) combined
with a port (supplied in the TCP packet). So a &#8220;socket&#8221; is
(IP,PORT). Socket + Socket = Connection. Hence, in this sense, you can
use the same socket for multiple connections.</p>

<blockquote><p>To allow for many processes within a single Host to use TCP
communication facilities simultaneously, the TCP provides a set of
addresses or ports within each host.  Concatenated with the network
and host addresses from the internet communication layer, this forms
a socket.  A pair of sockets uniquely identifies each connection.
That is, a socket may be simultaneously used in multiple
connections.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Socket: an operating system abstraction referring to a communication
endpoint. You can read from it. You can write to it.</li>
<li>Note that raw sockets don&#8217;t have ports (ports are a UDP/TCP concept).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Built-ins aren&#8217;t sudo-able</h2>

<pre><code>sudo: cd: command not found
</code></pre>

<p>:). Makes sense. You either need to use absolute paths or <code>sudo bash</code>.</p>

<h2>Switch into another user</h2>

<pre><code>sudo su - machty
</code></pre>

<h2>socket bind vs listen vs accept</h2>

<p>Why so many steps? What does each one do?</p>

<h3>Bind</h3>

<p>Registers a socket with the kernel. Even if you do nothing with that
socket, once you bind, anyone else who tries will get an EADDRINUSE.
This code gets an EADDRINUSE every time.</p>

<pre><code>require 'socket'
def wat
  socket = Socket.new(:INET, :STREAM)
  addr = Socket.pack_sockaddr_in(4485, '0.0.0.0')

  socket.bind(addr)
end

fork { wat }
wat
Process.wait
</code></pre>

<p>If the socket had been created, then a new file descriptor pointing to
the same socket could be used by the forked child process, but you can&#8217;t
just create a totally separate one that points to the same already-bound
port.</p>

<h3>Listen</h3>

<p><code>listen()</code> indicates a &#8220;willingness to accept incoming connections&#8221;.
You provide <code>listen</code> with a <code>backlog</code> integer referring to the max
number of queued connections allowed before you ECONNREFUSED.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s separate from <code>bind</code> because maybe you want to grab a port right at
application start, but you still need to do some thing before you know
a) whether to actually start listening or b) how big the queue size
should be.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s separate from <code>accept</code> because <code>accept</code> kind of a dead end as far
as application initialization goes; once you start <code>accept</code>ing, you must
be all set up and fine with the fact that you&#8217;ll be blocked on IO.</p>

<p>SOMAXCONN is the max backlog number. Probably best to just set
<code>listen</code>&#8217;s backlog to that number. If you&#8217;ve got people queued up for
connections, you should probably be fixing whatever&#8217;s causing the wait.</p>

<h3>Accept</h3>

<p><code>accept</code> will block.</p>

<p>So basically here&#8217;s what happens if you try to connect to a server
that&#8217;s ran through the following steps (followed by a sleep unless
<code>accept</code> is called):</p>

<ul>
<li>no <code>bind</code>: ECONNREFUSED</li>
<li><code>bind</code>: client blocks. If you kill the server, ECONNREFUSED</li>
<li><code>listen</code>: client blocks, reports a successful connection (which means
that <code>listen</code> makes the kernel start accepting connections even if no
one&#8217;s accepting&#8230; this makes sense since at this point we&#8217;ve provided
the kernel a max queue size)</li>
</ul>


<p>If a connection comes in, the kernel will do the handshake, but the
connection will remain in the queue and future connection attempts won&#8217;t
get the handshake until the first one is <code>accept</code>ed.</p>

<p>Does that make sense? The alternative would be the kernel not responding
to the handshake until <code>accept</code>, which seems like a major performance
hit.</p>

<h2>Elastic Beanstalk</h2>

<p>Tries to do what Heroku does. Apparently a clunkier CLI. But neato
features.</p>

<h2>Kernel buffers</h2>

<p>C and Ruby provide buffering on top of a kernel buffers. Why not just
have one buffer? Because the kernel definitely needs to provide
buffering in general so that you can get the perfs for free. But
application specific stuff can benefit from buffering on top of the
kernel&#8217;s defaults, but unfortunately the system calls are megaslow.</p>

<p>Kernel maintains a kernel thread that makes sure that nothing remains
unflushed for more than 30 seconds and will flush things.</p>

<p>You can <code>fadvise</code> the kernel about how reads/writes are likely to
occur so that it can select the best strategy for what you&#8217;re doing.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an <code>madvise</code> memory equivalent. Wouldn&#8217;t you just write your own
allocator at that point? Guess I should probably learn my shit.</p>

<p>Different types of strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li>NORMAL: no special patterns to report, default kernel behavior.
Read-ahead buffer set to 128k.</li>
<li>SEQUENTIAL: you&#8217;re gonna be reading from lower to higher offsets.
Large files, streaming large music files, blah blah blah, etc., on
linux this yields read-ahead window size 2x the default.</li>
<li>RANDOM: scattershot reads, hence read-ahead is likely a waste, hence
it is disabled.</li>
<li>WILLNEED: notify kernel that you&#8217;ll need a segment of memory soon, so
kernel loads it into the buffer cache (redundant much?). Memory
presurre from other processes might eject these buffers from the
cache, so it&#8217;s good to make sure you <code>read</code> soonish after this
fadvise.</li>
<li>WONTNEED: flush a region if possible</li>
<li>NOREUSE: WILLNEED + WONTNEED, basically. You only expect to read the
region once.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Unzip a curled tar</h2>

<pre><code>curl https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/bash/bash-92.tar.gz | tar zxf -
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty amazing.</p>

<h2><code>O_DIRECT</code>: bypass the buffer cache</h2>

<p>Often this means slower performance, but if you reaaaally know what
you&#8217;re doing, you can use it. If you use <code>O_DIRECT</code>, here&#8217;s what you
lose:</p>

<ul>
<li>sensible read-aheads</li>
<li>sharing buffers between processes using the same files</li>
<li>other things</li>
</ul>


<p>Database software probably wants <code>O_DIRECT</code> because databases have
unique IO requirements, maintain their own caches, etc.</p>

<p>You have to start paying attention to things like alignment
restrictions. The databuffer must begin on a memory boundary that is a
multiple of block size. I guess that means you have to shift things in
memory before writing to disk. File offset must also be multiple of
block size. Length of data transferred must also be multiple. Else
<code>EINVAL</code>.</p>

<h2>Write-ahead log</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging</p>

<p>Postgres et al use this to provide atomicity / durability. With WAL, all
modifications are written to a log before applied. Redo/undo information
is written to the log.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-in-time_recovery</p>

<p>Restore a previous state in time. Time Machine is OS X is an example of
this (also why they allow directory hard-linking).</p>

<h2>Virtual devices and device files</h2>

<p>Expose universal IO API.</p>

<p>There are character devices like TTYs which can handle a character at a
time, and there are block devices, which can handle IO in (often 512b)
blocks.</p>

<p>Use <code>mknod</code> for making device files. Used to be used for other things,
now it&#8217;s just device files.</p>

<p><code>ls -l</code> displays major or minor number of special device fields in place
of the size (from <code>man ls</code>)</p>

<pre><code> If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and
 minor device numbers for the file are displayed in the size field. 
</code></pre>

<h2>Cryptonomicomicon</h2>

<p>Words.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolie">Coolie</a>: a laborer from Southern
China, Indian subcontinent, Phillipines or Indonesia. Nowadays a
racial slur for people of Asian descent (mostly in South African
vernacular). Etymology not agreed upon, could be from an Urdu word for
&#8220;slave&#8221; or in reference to the Koli, or a Tamil word that meant payment
for work. Coolie trade pretty much was like slave trade, with indentured
servitude, etc. In Crypto they&#8217;re the workers who trade various Shanghai
banks silver-backed paper money in for silver, transporting large boxes
of currency hanging from bamboo sticks.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claque">Claque</a>: people paid to applaud
(or heckle) a performance. Basically, real-time proto-laugh tracks,
originating from France. There were laughers (Rieurs), criers
(Pleureurs), ticklers (Chatouilleurs, who kept the audience in high
spirits), and encore-ers (bisseurs). North Korea&#8217;s got lots of claquers.
Entrenched claque-masters also extorted money from performers in
exchange for not booing their performance. Fucking dickweeds.</p>

<p>Swabbie: &#8220;a member of the navy, typically one who is of low rank.&#8221;</p>

<p>Estuary (esturial): the tidal mouth of a large river, where the tide
meets the stream.</p>

<h2>Number authorities</h2>

<p>Kinda like the IANA and port numbers, there&#8217;s a Linux
http://www.lanana.org for controlling things like major version numbers
for device files.</p>

<h2>Silicon Valley</h2>

<p>Turns out I never knew where it was: it&#8217;s the southern portion of the
San Francisco bay area.</p>

<h2>Disk Partitions</h2>

<p>Hard disks have platters, platters have tracks of data, split into
sectors, split into physical blocks.</p>

<p>Platters > data > sectors > blocks.</p>

<p>Blocks are the smallest unit of data a driver can read/write. They&#8217;re
usually 512 bytes.</p>

<p>Disk partitions are treated by the kernel as separate devices in
<code>/dev</code>.</p>

<p>Partitions might consist of</p>

<ul>
<li>a file system</li>
<li>totally raw data (some databases do this)</li>
<li>swap area used by kernel for VM</li>
</ul>


<p>File system on disk is composed of</p>

<ul>
<li>Boot block: how to boot the OS</li>
<li>Superblock: single block saying:

<ul>
<li>size of inode table</li>
<li>logical block size (always a multiple of physical block)</li>
<li>size of the system in logical blocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>inode table / ilist</li>
<li>data blocks</li>
</ul>


<p><code>ext2</code> is special in that it breaks down data blocks into block groups
and prepends a copy of the super block to each to minimize seeks.</p>

<p><code>ls -li</code> shows inode number in first column. inodes contain:</p>

<ul>
<li>file type</li>
<li>owner</li>
<li>group</li>
<li>access perms</li>
<li>timestamps

<ul>
<li>last access</li>
<li>last mod</li>
<li>last status change</li>
<li>(but not a created at? WEIRD. must be a linux thing; mac has this)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>number of hardlinks</li>
<li>size of file in bytes</li>
<li>number of blocks allocated (might be less than expected due to holes)</li>
<li>pointers to blocks</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that there is a tradeoff between fragmenting freespace into small
chunks that are too small to use vs fragmenting data blocks so that all
free small chunks can be used.</p>

<p>ext2 has 15 pointers, 12 of which are data block pointers, the next
which points to a block of pointers, the next which points to a an array
of block pointers, and then a tertiary one for large fucking files.</p>

<p>This (using blocks for inode indirection) allows for fixed size
of inode table.</p>

<h2>TLDP</h2>

<p>The Linux Documentation Project</p>

<blockquote><p>LDP is a loosely knit team of volunteers who provide documentation for many aspects of Linux. There are several forms of documentation: Guides, HOWTOs, man pages, and FAQs.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s nice.</p>

<h2>McRouter</h2>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYhcumt8YyI</p>

<p>A &#8220;memcache protocol router, for scaling memcache deployments&#8221;.</p>

<p>Two forms of caching at facebook:</p>

<ul>
<li>demand-filled cache

<ul>
<li>fetch from memcache with key. if not there, fetch from db, then set
memcache w key. all of this logic on webserver</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>read-through / write-through cache

<ul>
<li>TAO system; query TAO, and if it&#8217;s not there, <em>it</em> fetches from DB
on your behalf</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Both share the following in common: two orders of magnitude more reads
than writes.</p>

<p>Cache becomes bottleneck, extremely crucial or whole site fails.</p>

<p>Having inconsistent implementations of memcache libs might result in
data loss. So, anyway, McRouter to the rescue. It:</p>

<ul>
<li>is a proxy between memcache client and server (adheres to same ol API,
makes for good drop-in replacement)</li>
<li>also an embedded mode for low latency</li>
<li>a load balancer</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing">consistent hashing</a>
(where hash table resizes minimize the amount of remapping:

<ul>
<li>Consistent hashing maps objects to the same cache machine, as
far as possible. It means when a cache machine is added,
it takes its share of objects from all the other cache
machines and when it is removed, its objects are shared
between the remaining machines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>connection pooling (presumably this means connections are maintained
by mcrouter to the memcache instances and loaned out when mcrouter
clients make queries, rather than slowly reopening connections each
time)</li>
<li>Server pools&#8230; I guess this means multiple instances of McRouter?</li>
<li>Automatic failover</li>
<li>Cold cache warmup</li>
<li>Broadcast operations</li>
<li>Replicated Data Sets</li>
</ul>


<p>Connection Pooling:</p>

<p>Application threads share McRouter&#8217;s N connections to the memcache
instances, rather then each thread creating N connections resulting in
<code>N*T</code> total connections.</p>

<p>Heterogeneous workloads:</p>

<p>Prefixed keys get routed to specific memcache instances, I guess, rather
than having them all on the same things getting clobbered by others.</p>

<p>Automatic failover:</p>

<p>Normal server, fail over to backup when error returned, timeout,
ECONNREFUSED, etc, with probing to see when it can be reconnected.</p>

<p>Twitter <code>twemproxy</code> is similar to McRouter.</p>

<h4>Reddit infrastructure</h4>

<ul>
<li>AWS</li>
<li>170-300 servers daily (scales in peak hours)</li>
<li>73 cache nodes with 1TB memory</li>
<li>App code fragile-y uses memcache</li>
</ul>


<h4>Reddit Scaling Issues</h4>

<p>AWS constantly releases lovely new instance types, but Reddit can&#8217;t just
hop onto them without testing them out.</p>

<h2>NTFS</h2>

<p>New Technology File System, as in, Windows NT.</p>

<h2>VFS</h2>

<p>Virtual File System: the unified kernel abstraction, providing familiar
things like <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, etc.</p>

<h2>Journaling</h2>

<p>If an OS running ext2 crashes, you need to run <code>fsck</code> (filesystem check)
to make sure inode entries point to real things, etc., else you run the
risk of breaking more shiznittletons.</p>

<p>Journaling FS&#8217;s imply basic database transactions. All intended metadata
writes are written to a journal file first before they&#8217;re performed, and
if the operation is interrupted by a crash, recovery is quick. Actually,
could just be metadata or full on everything data.</p>

<h2>OS X</h2>

<p>Macs use something called HFS Plus, or Mac OS Extended.</p>

<ul>
<li>lots of metadata</li>
<li><p>case-preserving though case-insensitive</p>

<p>  machty.github.com :: cat woot
  lol
  machty.github.com :: cat WOOT
  lol</p></li>
<li><p>journaling</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>mount</h2>

<p><code>mount</code> and <code>unmount</code> will attach a file system to a specified
directory.</p>

<p>KEEP IN MIND DINGUS this &#8220;mount&#8221; concept is all over the place. Mount
routes. Mount external thing blah.</p>

<p><code>unmount2</code> is <code>unmount</code> with flags.</p>

<p>You can mount in multiple mount points.</p>

<pre><code>mount /dev/sdva123 /dumbness
</code></pre>

<p>A device is not accessible as a file system until you mount it. You
couldn&#8217;t just do <code>cd /dev/sdva123</code>. You have to mount it first.</p>

<p>Just realized something: the EBS provided to your EC2 instance could be
formatted into any file system. FUCK IT let&#8217;s do ext4.</p>

<p>mounts can be stacked on top of the same mount point. This makes it
possible to migrate off of an old mount; old processes maintain their
file handles on the old mount, new processes use the new fs, and
eventually you can retire the old mounted fs that&#8217;s not at the top of
the stack. Kinda nifty, weird as it sounds.</p>

<h2>Basic <code>cat</code> shit</h2>

<p>If you want to type some random shit into a new file, do</p>

<pre><code>cat &gt; lolz
</code></pre>

<p>and then you can type into cat&#8217;s STDIN and then Control D to signal EOF.</p>

<h2>kitchen sink of disk utils</h2>

<p>What&#8217;s the difference between all these shits?</p>

<ul>
<li>fdisk: manipulate disk partition table</li>
<li>df: report file system disk space usage</li>
<li>mkfs: build a linux filesystem</li>
</ul>


<h2>tmpfs</h2>

<p>Virtual memory file system. But the thing about virtual memory is that
unused portions might get paged to a swap file on the disk&#8230; so it&#8217;s
not just strictly memory.</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir ./wat
sudo mount -t tmpfs StupidName ./wat
</code></pre>

<p><code>tmpfs</code> doesn&#8217;t exist on Mac OS X though some other form probably does.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s used to speed up applications like compilers that make heavy use of
<code>/tmp</code>.</p>

<p><code>tmpfs</code> has also had other use cases, such as implementing shared
memory (System V) and the <code>glibc</code> implementation of POSIX shared memory
and POSIX semaphores.</p>

<h2>Ableton Live</h2>

<ul>
<li>Opt-shift-B: hide Browser</li>
</ul>


<p>Arrangement view is the classic multi track view. You can disable
portions of the mixer that you don&#8217;t care about.</p>

<ul>
<li>IO (opt + command + i): input/output for this track

<ul>
<li>Input type (device, e.g. M-Audio Whatchufuck)</li>
<li>Input channel (devices often have multiple)</li>
<li>Monitoring (radio button basically)

<ul>
<li>In (enable monitoring of input)</li>
<li>Auto (only enable when track is armed - not just when actively
recording)</li>
<li>Off</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delay (no shortcut)

<ul>
<li>delay/predelay to compensate for device/hardware/whatever latency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mixer (opt + command + m)

<ul>
<li>Activate/deactivate (mute) the track</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return tracks

<ul>
<li>Note that if you tab into clip view (?) then the R button splits
into S and R.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Note the master track at the bottom. The Preview/Cue volume controls the
metrononme. Not sure what else Cue refers to&#8230;</p>

<p>Count-in is attached to the metronome menu.</p>

<p>Opt+unfold (triangle button) to unfold all them shits.</p>

<p>You can arm multiple tracks with command+click.</p>

<p>Impulse is an Ableton instrument. Instrument Racks are combinations of
the Impulse instrument with certain pre-saved audio effects.</p>

<h3>Quantize</h3>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to refer to individual notes in a midi recording but
rather for playback between clips; when you press the play button by a
clip, it doesn&#8217;t immediately play unless you have it turned off (which
can result in crazy timing issues). Also, even if you Command-0 to turn
it off and get shit out of sync, if you Command-9 back to one bar and
play a new track, it&#8217;ll make sure it starts in sync with the metronome
(what else could it be? clips don&#8217;t have meter, just a length).</p>

<p>Ah but if you do want per note quantization you can do it a) while
recording, by going to Edit > Record Quantization.</p>

<p>Then if you already recorded something unquantized, you can Command-U.</p>

<h3>Recording clips</h3>

<p>If you create an empty clip, that clip has a size, as all do, so you&#8217;ll
be recording within a loop.</p>

<p>Whereas if you pressed the slot&#8217;s record button, there would be no fixed
length until you stopped recording. The Notes menu associated with that
clip (which has length info) doesn&#8217;t even appear until after the new
recording is finished. How grand!</p>

<h3>Looping</h3>

<ul>
<li>One-indexing: the quickly set things to the beginning of a clip, you
do 1 tab 1 tab 1, not 0 tab 0 tab 0 which&#8217;ll normalize to -1. But
lengths can have zero. 2 0 0 means two measures.</li>
<li>Known trick: 0 0 16 will normalize into 1. If it&#8217;s more convenient to
think in terms of odd meters, this could be useful&#8230; INSTANT
MESHUGGAH.</li>
<li>When loop enabled, normal end is meaningless. When loop disabled, all
loop info is useless. (Though these details still seem to be
displayed.</li>
</ul>


<p>Place insert markers just by clicking the grid.</p>

<p>You can manually copy and paste or you could DuplLoop. DuplLoop also
conveniently works such that if you duplicate into notes you&#8217;ve already
written, they&#8217;re overwritten, rather than dubbed or something cray cray.</p>

<h3>Hotswapping</h3>

<p>Constrasted with double-clicking a new instrument in the Browser,
hotswapping seems to:</p>

<ul>
<li>preserve the rest of the devices you might have attached to the
instrument you&#8217;re hotswapping.</li>
<li>open the browser to the current devices folder; relevant for quickly
finding the thing you want to switch out.</li>
</ul>


<p>Weird that they make such a big deal out of it (do they, or am i just
saying).</p>

<h2>SHIT IS EBS BACKED, DUMMY</h2>

<p>Root device type: ebs</p>

<p>Root device: <code>/dev/xvda</code></p>

<p><code>#NotAllEC2InstancesStartOffWithEphemeralStorage</code></p>

<h2>Helicopter parent</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent</p>

<p>A hovery overbearing parent who&#8217;s still around even when kids have gone
to college.</p>

<p>Thought it might mean when you&#8217;re a parent who drops in every so often,
or drops in on other kids. Nope.</p>

<h2>Geocoder can&#8217;t have radiuses be stored on the row</h2>

<p>The bounding box is calculated before the SQL is fired&#8230; then again
there&#8217;s all sorts of sin/cos shit going on, but all to translate into
something that can be compared against that box.</p>

<h2>College</h2>

<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-gets-to-graduate.html</p>

<p>Community College:</p>

<p>Means different things depending on the country, but in America it
usually means a two-year public institution, often granting certificates
and associate&#8217;s degrees (two-year degrees).</p>

<p>Dropout rate is apparently 40%, and if you include community college
dropouts, we&#8217;re the worst other than Hungary.</p>

<p>Rich kids are more likely to graduate (90% of the upper quartile of
income), whereas 25% of the lower half will expect to graduate by 24.</p>

<p>College students who scored the same on standardized tests still have
educational outcomes (graduation rates) that correlate with family
wealth.</p>
