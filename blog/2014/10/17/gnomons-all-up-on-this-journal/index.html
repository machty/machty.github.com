	<h2 class="title">Gnomons All Up on This Journal</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><h2>timerfd</h2>

<p>Just like any other api that inverts signal-handling API into something
file handle-y, Linux has such an API for expiring timers, which means
you can use these file handles w functions like <code>select</code>, <code>poll</code>, and
<code>epoll</code>.</p>

<h2>CLOEXEC reminder</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve already kinda learned this but I FORGET. The CLOEXEC flag is
something that appears in <code>open</code> and other APIs that create a file
handle; it means that if <code>exec</code> is ever called on a process with a
CLOEXEC handle, the handle will close rather than leak to a process that
can&#8217;t even really access that file handle.</p>

<h2>spawn = fork + exec</h2>

<p>Allows for greater degree of flexibility in what happens between those
two steps. Node only has spawn because it&#8217;s trying to be cross platform.
There&#8217;s no fork. There&#8217;s no spoon.</p>

<p><code>posix_spawn</code> exists to more directly spawn a process when <code>fork</code> is not
supported.</p>

<h2>Embedded System</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system</p>

<p>Usually means you&#8217;re running software on some piece of hardware with a
dedicated purpose, limited resources, and real-time requirements. It&#8217;s a
computer system embedded into some larger mechanical whole.</p>

<h2>fork</h2>

<p>No guarantee of where parent or child is scheduled to run so don&#8217;t run
into conditions.</p>

<p><code>fork</code>ing can be wasteful especially if immediately <code>exec</code>ing, cept for
the fact that</p>

<ul>
<li>program text is marked read only and often shares the same page
mapping as parent</li>
<li>copy-on-write</li>
</ul>


<p>You can execute code in a single-purpose forked child process without
changing the resource/memory footprint of the parent. Useful if the code
in question is unspeakably/unstoppably leaky or prone to memory fragmentation.</p>

<p>Mmm mmm mmm using pipes.</p>

<pre><code>r,w = IO.pipe

if fork
  w.close
  answer = r.read
  Process.wait
  puts $?.exitstatus
  puts answer
else
  r.close
  w.write("SOME BULLSHIT")
  exit(123)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Useful for when the single byte/octet return code (<code>$?.exitstatus</code>)
won&#8217;t cut it. Insane Posse Clown.</p>

<p>BSD used to have a shit wasteful fork back in the day, then added vfork,
and then everyone else made efficient COW <code>fork</code>s, but still most people
provide an implementation of vfork which:</p>

<ul>
<li>performs zero duplication, even of VM pages (which all forks due, even
if no writes have happened yet under a COW system). Parent memory
shared until <code>exec</code> or <code>_exit</code>.</li>
<li>Parent execution suspended til then</li>
</ul>


<p>This is risky as fuck because:</p>

<ul>
<li>simply returning from a function will impact parent process&#8217;s memory.
It&#8217;s almost like a step-through longjmp, cept, no this totally breaks.
It&#8217;s not like the parent will pick up from wherever the child process
leaves off; the process counters are different between processes, so
if you return from a function in a child, you&#8217;ll fuck with the stack
frame, probably cause some SEGVs, and bite the big one.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can on the other handle futz with file handles in this time
(apparently these are duplicated? just not VM pages?)</p>

<pre><code>vfork -- spawn new process in a virtual memory efficient way
</code></pre>

<p><code>_exit</code> must be used because <code>exit</code> would flush stdio and thus fuck the
parent.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t use vfork. It sucks. It&#8217;s obsolete. It&#8217;s not even in SUSv4.
It&#8217;s garbage shit-kicker nonsense. <code>fork</code> is pretty much just as fast
when COW exists.</p>

<p>You can actually control whether parent or child runs first via
<code>proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first</code> (or the sysctl equiv).</p>

<p>The argument for parent-first is that the TLB cache is warm with parent
stuff, so memory lookups are faster yadda yadaa I can&#8217;t imagine this
actually makes a difference unless you&#8217;re forking like a motherforker.</p>

<p>Hehehehe:</p>

<pre><code>3.times { fork }
puts "wat"
</code></pre>

<p>Results in</p>

<pre><code>wat
wat
wat
wat
wat
wat
wat
wat
</code></pre>

<p><code>atexit</code> handlers are shared w <code>fork</code>.</p>

<h2>Process rehash, new learnings</h2>

<p>Even if a parent kills a child, it has to wait or else it remains a
zombie.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no such thing as a zombie orphan; well actually there are
transient zombie orphans; <code>init</code> will adopt them and immediately <code>wait</code>
on them, and then they&#8217;ll be collected.</p>

<p>Prediction: it gets messy to call <code>wait</code> in a SIGCHLD handler since
signals might coalesce; two SIGCHLDs might coalesce into one, and the
foolish programmer might only wait once. I bet if I looked at unicorn
I&#8217;d find a loop.</p>

<h2>KGIO</h2>

<p>http://bogomips.org/kgio/</p>

<p>Ruby gem w C extensions for Kinder, Gentler IO.</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoids expensive EAGAIN / EINPROGRESS exceptions

<ul>
<li>EAGAIN: non-blocking IO when there&#8217;s no data, so try <em>again</em> later</li>
<li>EINPROGRESS: (less common), similar to EAGAIN but distinguished for
things like <code>connect</code> in mid 3-way handshake</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>other niceties</li>
</ul>


<p>Used in Unicorn and related Rainbows!. Can&#8217;t use in JRuby obviously but
then again no forking server model is supported in JRuby.</p>

<h2>JRuby Servers</h2>

<p>https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Servers</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t use unicorn but you can use things like Puma, or Trinidad, which
wraps rack/rails within a Tomcat container. So many things I do not
know!</p>

<h2>Isomorphic Code</h2>

<p>Can run on server or client. Not sure of the roots, but sounds like it
started in 2011, at least as way of describing JS code that runs between
both? React-router is &#8220;isomorphic&#8221;.</p>

<h2>ELF format</h2>

<p>Executable and Linking Format.</p>

<h2>Built-ins</h2>

<p>Sometimes no forking occurs because it&#8217;s quick and efficient, or because
there are desirable side effects that should make it into the current
shell process. Like <code>cd</code> (can&#8217;t change the cwd of the current process
if you&#8217;re forking). Or <code>export</code>.</p>

<h2>Why keep fd&#8217;s open on <code>exec</code>?</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re exec&#8217;ing, shouldn&#8217;t you lose access to file handles? Not
necessarily; stream redirection via the shell is a good example where
you preserve what 0 1 2 point to.</p>

<h2>Auto-reap zombie child processes</h2>

<p>If you set the signal mask to ignore <code>SIG_CHLD</code>, potential zombie child
processes will be automatically reaped. So no need to <code>wait</code> in that
case.</p>

<p>Also, it&#8217;s implementation-defined (according to SUS) whether <code>exec</code>
resets the <code>SIG_CHLD</code> disposition after an exec (Linux preserves,
Solaris resets to default, etc).</p>

<h2><code>exec</code> clears sig handlers</h2>

<p>Of course, since sig handlers live in the text and text is replaced, so
must handled signals be reset. Everything else about signals is
preserved (cept that <code>SIG_CHLD</code> ignores may not
get reset to <code>DFL</code> depending on the implementation), but since most
processes expect to start with a clean slate, if you didn&#8217;t write the
process, you should reset everything yourself before an exec.</p>

<h2><code>system</code></h2>

<p>Runs a shell command, with all the processing/substitutions of the
command string that you would expect.</p>

<p>Inefficient; fork+execs twice, one for the shell, and one for the
process you intend to run.</p>

<p>set-user-id and set-group-id programs should never use <code>system</code>
since it opens the door to setting weird ENV vars to get unintended
programs to run, and they&#8217;ll inherit the effective user id. The
canonical example is setting IFS to <code>a</code>, and then <code>shar</code> runs and is
interpreted as <code>sh r</code>, and <code>r</code> is some script/executable that is no
running with admin privileges to do whatever it wants. Evil shit!</p>

<p>Note that modern shells reset IFS now as a rule.</p>

<h2><code>clone</code></h2>

<p>A Linux-specific sister of <code>fork</code>; it creates a new process, but starts
at the beginning of a provided function called w a provided arg. The
child process terminates if this function returns (or the exit variants
are called).</p>

<ul>
<li>you can specify termination signal (rather than always CHLD)</li>
<li>flags let you meticulously control a variety of info about what is
actually shared with the new child process: file handles, signal
dispositions, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>So basically it&#8217;s threads&#8230; but separate processes? Is there a name for
these kinds of threads? LinuxThreads I guess.</p>

<p>Threads/processes are just kernel scheduling entities with differing
degrees of shared attributes. Processes are just, like, organizational
distinctions. Schedule wise, the scheduler doesn&#8217;t care whether it&#8217;s a
thread or a process. Blueskying of course.</p>

<h2>Mode 7</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_7</p>

<p>The special background layer mode that enabled perspective-y effects, as
well as zooming and other cool things. F-zero relied on it, the map in
Link to Past relied on it. Any zoomy crazy shit that wasn&#8217;t a sprite
relied on it.</p>

<h2>Dyson Sphere</h2>

<p>Shell around the sun.</p>

<p>http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM</p>

<p>Other lifeforms smashed apart their planets to build a dyson sphere to
capture energy, support population growth.</p>

<p>We could knock apart Jupiter, use its mass to create a sphere around sun
with a diameter twice that of Earth&#8217;s orbit. The shell would be 10 feet
thick, and make&#8230; something&#8230; habitable?</p>

<h2>Fermi Paradox</h2>

<p>http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox</p>

<p>The apparent contradiction between the high probability of alien life
and the fact that no one has contacted us yet.</p>

<p>Explanation 1: They don&#8217;t exist</p>

<p>Possibly due to a Great Filter; at some point in development, something
wipes them out, or there&#8217;s some point of evolution that&#8217;s reaaaally
really hard to get beyond that filters out people who made it beyond the
previous step.</p>

<p>So where does that leave <em>us</em>?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re</p>

<ul>
<li><p>rare</p>

<ul>
<li>other rare survivors might be reaaaally far away</li>
<li>the filter is behind us</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>first: no one else to communicate with yet</p></li>
<li>fucked: we&#8217;re about to hit our wall like everyone else has</li>
</ul>


<p>Ah I love the potentialy reason for why intelligent life wouldn&#8217;t
broadcast data: there are potential harmful civilizations that would
destroy anyone they could find, and most advanced civilizations are
smart enough not to give away their locations to these fuckers. That&#8217;s
why we only have SETI today, and not METI (messaging to ETs), which most
scientists agree is a profoundly unwise idea.</p>

<p>Eesh, or there&#8217;s only one superpredator species, like humans on Earth,
that would wipe out another species before it got too intelligent.
Nipping the universe in the bud. Fuuuck that.</p>

<p>Or we&#8217;re not using the right technologies to communicate, or even if we
did, other minds might work much faster or slower than ours; it could
take years for them to say hello. Hahaha.</p>

<p>Or we are receiving communications but the gov is hiding it.</p>

<p>Or other civilizations see us, but we&#8217;re a look-don&#8217;t-touch zoo.</p>

<p>Or the higher civilizations are here, but we couldn&#8217;t begin to
understand them, they&#8217;re just so advanced.</p>

<p>Or we&#8217;re just so fundamentally incorrect about reality.</p>

<p>Types of civilization</p>

<ul>
<li>I: ability to use all the energy on the planet (Sagan says we&#8217;re a
0.7; just under the legal limit)</li>
<li>II: ability to harness all power of a star (e.g. Dyson sphere)</li>
<li>III: ability to harness all power of a whole galaxy</li>
</ul>


<p>http://waitbutwhy.com/ seems pretty awesome in general. Three thumbs up.</p>

<h2>fork v vfork</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve already written about this but followup: vfork is faster, but
considering how slow the followup <code>exec</code> is, this is probably
neglibibilgigible.</p>

<h2><code>time</code> and forking</h2>

<p>Are child process CPU times included?</p>

<pre><code>N = 20000000

def slow_thing
  inc = N / 5
  N.times do |i|
    puts "." if i % inc == 0
  end
end

do_fork = true
if do_fork
  fork do
    slow_thing
  end

  Process.wait
else
  slow_thing
end
</code></pre>

<p>With forking:</p>

<pre><code>real    0m1.565s
user    0m1.544s
sys     0m0.013s
</code></pre>

<p>Without forking:</p>

<pre><code>real    0m1.480s
user    0m1.464s
sys     0m0.011s
</code></pre>

<p>Seems that yes they are (there&#8217;s no difference with the above).
Actually, quick aside: it seems that <code>time</code> is a bash builtin. Not sure
why, but if I use <code>/usr/bin/time</code> as well, not much changes</p>

<pre><code>1.42 real         1.41 user         0.00 sys
1.49 real         1.47 user         0.01 sys
</code></pre>

<p>Ah, <code>time</code> will add together all forked processes. And apparently if you
have two active processes, you might wind up with a CPU time greater
than real time. LET US FIND THE FUCK OUT.</p>

<pre><code>N = 20000000

def slow_thing
  inc = N / 5
  N.times do |i|
    puts "." if i % inc == 0
  end
end

num_forks = 2

num_forks.times do
  fork do
    slow_thing
  end
end

num_forks.times { Process.wait }
</code></pre>

<p>BOO YA</p>

<pre><code>real    0m1.636s
user    0m3.199s
sys     0m0.021s
</code></pre>

<p>How awesome is it when things start clickin.</p>

<p>So how does time actually do it?</p>

<h2>curl + tar</h2>

<pre><code>curl http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/gnu/time/time-1.7.tar.gz | tar -x
</code></pre>

<p>I guess you&#8217;re also supposed to use <code>-z</code> as well, but in my manpages:</p>

<pre><code> -z      (c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with gzip(1).  In extract
         or list modes, this option is ignored.  _Note that, unlike other tar
         implementations, this implementation recognizes gzip compression auto-
         matically when reading archives._
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s so nice of them. And ridiculous that it wouldn&#8217;t always work that
way. Maybe not.</p>

<h2>Threads</h2>

<p>Every process has at least one thread.</p>

<p>Concurrency via processes has some limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>nothing is shared so communication is limited to IPC, pipes and what
not</li>
<li>expensive due to page table duplication and file descriptor table dups
and all the things that happen during <code>fork</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Most process attributes are shared between threads. Here&#8217;s some stuff
that&#8217;s not:</p>

<ul>
<li>thread ID</li>
<li>signal mask</li>
<li>thread-specific data</li>
<li>alternate signal stack</li>
<li><code>errno</code></li>
<li>floating-point env</li>
<li>scheduling priority/policy</li>
<li>CPU affinity</li>
<li>capabilities</li>
<li>stack</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course you could share stack vars between threads but this runs the
risk of data invalidation once a function returns etc etc etc.</p>

<p>How does errno work if it&#8217;s a variable? Trick question, it&#8217;s a macro
that evals to an lvalue (so you can still manually set it yourself).</p>

<p><code>join</code> is like <code>wait</code>, it seems to free up that thread, and you wouldn&#8217;t
want to call it twice, lest terrible things happen. You must detach or
join. (Seems like the equiv in processland for detach is to set
<code>SIG_CHLD</code> to ignore).</p>

<p>Unlike processes, threads are created as peers. If A spawns B spawns C,
then A can join C. They&#8217;re all siblings in the same process cult.
There&#8217;s no concept of generic <code>Process.wait</code> to join with any ol thread.
This makes sense since some lib function could spawn a thread and you
might clobber its operation and steal its return value.</p>

<p>Once you detach a thread, you can&#8217;t join it. Again keep in mind that
threads can&#8217;t escape the fact that they live in a process; if the
process dies, so do the threads.</p>

<p>Threads can&#8217;t use the full virtual memory address space; they have to
share with all the other threads. Probably not a big deal unless you&#8217;re
doing insane shit, but still.</p>

<p>Mutexes in Linux are implemented in user spaces using futexes (fast user
space mutexes). They only cause system calls when multiple threads lock.</p>

<h2>Pitchblende</h2>

<p>Old school word for Uraninite. Basically ore ready for uranium
processing.</p>

<h2>Javascryptonomicomicon</h2>

<p>http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/</p>

<h2>ffs ssl</h2>

<p>http://wingolog.org/archives/2014/10/17/ffs-ssl</p>

<blockquote><p>WTF their price is 49 dollars for a stupid certificate? Your domain name was only 10 dollars, and domain name resolution is an actual ongoing service, unlike certificate issuance that just happens one time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hmm clearly I need to better understand how this all works&#8230; being a
CA, root or no, definitely requires constant service</p>

<p>Wow this is sneaky: http://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste</p>

<p>Never copy and paste secure stuff from a webpage. I&#8217;m so sad.</p>

<p>Lol &#8220;Well now I have to live with this confidence-inspiring dialog,
because I left off the organization&#8221;</p>

<p>TIL Organization is the name you choose that you want to pop up when
inspecting certifications.</p>

<p>Wow, googlebot still doesn&#8217;t use TLS 1.2.</p>

<h2>Condition variables</h2>

<p>Didn&#8217;t I write about this already? So forgetful!</p>

<pre><code>Loop
  Lock around shared structure
    If shared structure "empty"/unusable, wait on condition variable


(other thread):
Lock around shared structure
  Put data into it
  Signal Condition variable
</code></pre>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t do this, you&#8217;d have some wasteful CPU-hog loop that
constantly locked and unlocked the mutex to check if the shared
structure had data ready.</p>

<ul>
<li>Always re-check the condvar predicate; some other thread might have
invalidated it in the meantime.</li>
<li>Also, a looseness of predicates lends to some flexibility; a producer
doesn&#8217;t need to know the exactly logic that consumer cond var depends
on; producer can just say &#8220;hey interested people, this shared
structure changed, so chiggity check yourselves&#8221;</li>
<li>Some implementations, particularly multi-core, might wake up a cond
var for fucks sake (explicitly allowed by SUSv3</li>
</ul>


<h2>Reentrant revisited</h2>

<p>We already knew thread-safe functions aren&#8217;t necessarily reentrant (e.g.
a signal handler that locks a mutex might be reentered and deadlock the
same mutex on the same thread). A reentrant function is one that doesn&#8217;t
access globals, mutexes included (what if a shared structure, possibly a
mutex is passed on to the function? Deadlock could still occur&#8230; I
guess the answer is that a function might be itself reentrant, but a
caller might not be reentrant so the chain of calls it makes with
whatever global data it&#8217;s using isn&#8217;t going to be reentrant).</p>

<p>Not every function can be reentrant. malloc can&#8217;t be: it <em>must</em> access
global data. A <code>_r</code> suffix implies reentrancy.</p>

<h2><code>pthread_once</code></h2>

<p>The pthreads library provides facilities for ensuring that some kind of
initialization (that occurs in the function you provide it) only happens
once.</p>

<h2>Thread-specific data</h2>

<p>I guess it&#8217;s a thread-local storage, but TLS is an overlay API that&#8217;s
friendlier to program in. In C at least you use the <code>__thread</code> keyword
when declaring a variable and voila you get everything for freeee.</p>

<h2>Thread cancellation</h2>

<p>Threads can be cancelled at cancellation points, SUS-specified
lib/syscall functions, or if you&#8217;re a moron (or you have a 0.001% use
case) you can set cancelability to be async, which means it might
interrupt at any ol machine instruction.</p>

<h2>ncurses</h2>

<p>New curses. Used for writing terminal apps. Cross-terminal. Optimizes
refreshes for our remotely connected friends.</p>

<h2>Thread stacks</h2>

<p>Main thread has mucho size, thread stacks are smaller but configurable
in size.</p>

<h2>Signals and threads</h2>

<p>Horrible combination, avoid when possible. Reason being: signals existed
long before threads and never expected to integrate with them.</p>

<ul>
<li>signal dispositions are process wide (you can&#8217;t have one thread ignore
a signal and another use a specific handler, etc)</li>
<li>signals might be directed to thread or process. Thread directed if

<ul>
<li>signal is result of hardware instruction (SEGV, etc&#8230; same
reason that signals are sometimes synchronous)</li>
<li>SIGPIPE</li>
<li><code>pthread_kill</code> or <code>pthread_sigqueue</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>all others are process wide</li>
<li>kernel selects arbitrary thread to handle signal (as opposed to
multiple threads handling a single sig)</li>
</ul>


<p>Shit. What the fuck is a difference between signal disposition and
signal mask?</p>

<p>Disposition: per-process structure that controls whether a signal
is a) is ignored, b) runs a custom handler, or c) invokes the default
action.</p>

<p>Mask: data structure that knows when signals are temporarily blocked,
the idea being that they should be later unblocked and the signal will
fire.</p>

<p>OK so dispositions are process-wide, but masks are thread-local; so as
one time slice begins, the kernel will look up the mask for that thread
and decide whether a pending signal should fire upon it, and if not,
wait til later. You might have some threads that block all signal
handlers.</p>

<p>Ahhhhhhh SO FUCKING FORGETFUL. Didn&#8217;t I just cover this a few days ago?
Basically I tried writign a ruby program to set the mask, but you don&#8217;t
have access to the mask in Ruby because Ruby uses it internally and is
trying to layer a nice signal API on top of it. I was trying to set up
something where a main thread had a custom handler but all the threads
it spawned blocked SIGINT so that it must be handled by the main thread.</p>

<p>But if I weren&#8217;t too lazy to write the test in C:</p>

<blockquote><p>By manipulating the per-thread signal masks, an application can control which thread(s) may handle a signal that is directed to the whole process.</p></blockquote>

<p>I mostly just wanna know how the kernel selects the thread to wake up.
Does it just loop through each of the sleeping threads and find the one
whose signal mask will allow it?</p>

<p>None of the pthread lib has async-signal-safe functions, so what&#8217;s
recommended:</p>

<ul>
<li>main thread blocks everything, all spawned threads inherit signal mask</li>
<li>single thread deblocks and is responsible for dispatching signals.</li>
</ul>


<p>Reminder: difference b/w reentrant and async-signal-safe:
async-signal-safe is a function you can call in a signal handler because
it as either a) reentrant or b) not interruptible by a signal handler.</p>

<p>So why &#8220;async&#8221;-signal-safe? There are sync signals and async signals
depending on whether hardware issued the signal, whether it&#8217;s a signal
sent to yourself, etc. I think the answer is that async-signal-safe is a
concept that exists even outside of the context of a currently running
signal handler. In other words, if you know <code>foo</code> is NOT async signal
safe, it means <code>foo</code> might be interrupted by an async signal, and if
itself were called, hell might break loose.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s a useful concept on its own, but when applied to what you&#8217;re
allowed to call within a signal handler, the rule is &#8220;don&#8217;t call non
async-signal-safe functions&#8221; because, within a handler or no, you might
be interrupted by <em>another</em> signal handler and fuck yourself.</p>

<p>So you should always write signal handlers that are themselves reentrant
and only call async-signal-safe functions.</p>

<p>Remember, these async-signal-safe functions might not be reentrant on
their own, but because they block signal handlers from interrupting
them, they are async-signal-safe.</p>

<p><code>exec</code> wipes out all other threads entirely. Gone. No termination /
cancel handlers called.</p>

<p><code>fork</code> kills all other threads than the caller, but mutexes and
conditional variables live on in whatever state. (What about
<code>thread_t</code>s? Probably persist but point to dead threads?). Memory leaks
can happen since the killed threads don&#8217;t have an opportunity to clean
up after themselves.</p>

<p>LOVE.</p>

<p>But you can defined atfork handlers. Otherwise you probably shouldn&#8217;t
fork unless you&#8217;re also <code>exec</code>-ing.</p>

<h2>NPTL</h2>

<p>Native POSIX Threading Lib</p>

<p>The software feature in linux kernel that enabled POSIX-compliant
threads. Red Hat 9 added it first, either as a kernel module or patch to
the OSS kernel.</p>

<h2>Social Engineering</h2>

<pre><code>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)
</code></pre>

<p>It just means sneakily manipulating people into giving away their shit.
Phishing and what not.</p>

<h2>M:N</h2>

<p>aka number of threads map to number of Kernel Scheduling Entities
(processes, threads, etc, schedulable executable things).</p>

<h3>M:1</h3>

<p>Multiple threads to a single KSE. User-level threads aka green threads.
Kernel doesn&#8217;t know about these threads.  Fast context switching, but</p>

<ul>
<li>other slow syscalls block all other threads, e.g. <code>read</code>, since
control is passed from user-spacing threading lib to kernel</li>
<li>kernel can&#8217;t schedule, which means no multi-processor green threads.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m guessing the way scheduling worked was to set interval timers and
pre-empty threads. Seems correct.</p>

<h3>1:1</h3>

<p>Kernel-level threads. Pthreads.</p>

<p>Thread creation, context switching, etc, are slower since it requires a
syscall, but it means the kernel can efficiently schedule, put them on
separate cores.</p>

<h3>M:N</h3>

<p>Some kernel, some green.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this whole <code>M:N</code> nomenclature also applies to
processes vs threads. err, does it? Processes and green threads? I could
be bullsharting right now.</p>

<p>M:N is complex, perhaps not worth it. It was originally the suggested
implementation for NPTL.</p>

<h2>Process Group / Session</h2>

<ul>
<li>Process group

<ul>
<li>Process group leader

<ul>
<li>Process that creates the group, whose PID becomes the process group
ID</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New process inherits its parent&#8217;s pgid</li>
<li>Lifetime: from process group creation to when last process leaves
group id</li>
<li>premature question: can a new process take the id of a now-dead
process that used to be pg leader?</li>
<li>processes can leave by terminating or joining another group</li>
<li>pg leader can leave before others, no biggie.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Session

<ul>
<li>collection of PGs</li>
<li>Session leader

<ul>
<li>Process that creates the session, whose PID becomes the session ID</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New process inherits its parent&#8217;s pgid</li>
<li>all processes in session share terminal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>SIGHUP is sent to PG leader when terminal disconnects.</p>

<p>Login:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shell becomes session leader AND process group leader

<ul>
<li>every command it runs, it makes it process group leader (but shell
remains session leader)</li>
<li>any command forks have same process group id (the command&#8217;s pid),
and session id is shell.</li>
<li>shell can create many process groups (commands) and can foreground
one and the rest are background</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>You can only change process group of yourself or your children, else
ESRCH. You can only move a process between groups within the same
session. You can&#8217;t change the process group of the session leader.
You can&#8217;t child the process group of a child if it&#8217;s already called
<code>exec</code> (you might confuse the poor child); I guess this means shells
will fork and then the parent will call setpgid on the child&#8230;? Why
doesn&#8217;t the child just do it itself?</p>

<p>Answer (and I love this book for this shit: go buy the Linux Programming
Interface right now): the parent process needs to be able to send job
control signals to the newly created child (to the new process group
ID it&#8217;ll have), and the child needs to set the new pgid before it
<code>exec</code>s or else all is lost, so how do you guarantee that the new process
group on the child has been set before either the parent or child
proceed? Answer: do it on both and ignore errors on the parent.</p>

<p><code>setsid</code> establishes a process as group and session leader and
disconnects it from any controlling terminal. You can&#8217;t <code>setsid</code> if
you&#8217;re process group leader (EPERM), so you need to <code>fork</code> first to get around
that. This restriction is in place because any other process group
children will still have a pgid that points to this same process group
leader process even if it has a new session id; the only way to ensure
the numbers don&#8217;t point to the same place is to distribute new numbers,
e.g. new process ids, e.g by forking.</p>

<pre><code>if fork
  Process.wait
  puts "done"
else
  # if you hadn't forked, setsid would fail because
  # this process would be PG leader
  Process.setsid
  puts gets
end
</code></pre>

<p>The above code doesn&#8217;t error out like I thought it would&#8230; it still has
access to the terminal, but, it, umm, couldn&#8217;t open the terminal if it
wanted to?</p>

<p>When session leader opens a controlling terminal, it becomes the
controlling process for a terminal. They are LINKED. If a process
has a controlling terminal, it can open special file <code>/dev/tty</code>.</p>

<p>Ah ok so to make the above snippet break, I should have actually done</p>

<pre><code>fork do
  Process.setsid
  File.open('/dev/tty')
end
Process.wait
</code></pre>

<p>which yields</p>

<pre><code>setsid.rb:3:in `initialize': Device not configured - /dev/tty (Errno::ENXIO)
</code></pre>

<p>You open <code>/dev/tty</code> if the shell (or someone else) already redirected
your output (by <code>dup2</code>ing 0 1 2 file descriptors) and you want to get
back in touch with your <code>tty</code>. Call your <code>tty</code>. She&#8217;s your controlling
terminal.</p>

<p>AH HA this is how you can take a program with redirected input and get,
say, the users password from the terminal. Fuckin badass. Let&#8217;s try it.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "wat" | ruby getpass.rb
here's some stuff from stdin
wat
now type something in: borflex
You wrote borflex
</code></pre>

<p>So many cool shits!</p>

<p>Note that you can also open <code>/dev/tty</code> without it becoming the
controlling terminal.</p>

<p>TTY captures special characters, converts into signals sent to members
of the foreground process group.</p>

<p>This demonstrates how a signal is delivered to literally everyone in the
foreground process group (5 &#8220;omg&#8221;s are printed).</p>

<pre><code>N = 5
N.times do
  fork do
    trap(:INT) do
      puts "omg\n"
      exit
    end
    sleep
  end
end

trap(:INT) do
  puts "main\n"
end

N.times do
  Process.wait
end
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s possible for no one to be the foreground process, but rare, and not
when there&#8217;s a shell that&#8217;s monitoring for foreground process to quit
(via wait or some other signal handle).</p>

<p><code>tcgetpgrp</code> gets the foreground process group of a provided terminal fd.
<code>bash</code> and other shells make use of this when passing the terminal
around to child processes.</p>

<h2>SIGHUP</h2>

<p>This is sent when terminal connection is severed (also sends SIGCONT to
make sure the process is alive). Happens when:</p>

<ul>
<li>terminal driver detects disconnect of one form or another</li>
<li>the last pseudoterminal file handle has been closed (i don&#8217;t
understand this)</li>
</ul>


<p>You can ignore / handle SIGHUP but future reads yield EOF. (What about
output? Same thang?).</p>

<p>SIGHUP is often used to tell a daemon process to reload a config file.
Why SIGHUP? Because daemons have no controlling terminal so the single
is otherwise useless; why not put it to work in some useful way? nginx
and others do this.</p>

<p>When terminal disconnects, the controlling process (the shell) gets a
SIGHUP. Shells will terminate, but before doing that they&#8217;ll send a
SIGHUP to each of the process groups.</p>

<p><code>nohup</code> just forks, sets disposition to ignore HUP, and then <code>exec</code>s.
Easy peasy.</p>

<p>Note that shells won&#8217;t send SIGHUP to any process groups it didn&#8217;t
create.</p>

<pre><code>echo $$
</code></pre>

<p>This is like the thing that trolled me before w <code>ruby -e</code>&#8230; <code>$$</code> in a
shell command is the shell&#8217;s pid.</p>

<p>Background tasks don&#8217;t get sighup&#8217;d when you exit a terminal. SIGHUP
only gets sent to foreground processes. That seems cray cray.</p>

<h2>$$ in Ruby</h2>

<p>Everywhere I look it says it is the id of the running process. As in,
you know, the pid. But if I do</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e "puts Process.pid; puts $$"
</code></pre>

<p>I get two different numbers.</p>

<p>You know why?</p>

<p>Because, of course, <code>$$</code> means something to shells! Before the command
even runs, <code>$$</code> will be substituted with the pid of the shell! If I
change double quotes to single quotes, I get the same numbers, of
course!</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e 'puts Process.pid; puts $$'
</code></pre>

<p>This is why I started going crazy and thinking that the internet was
just wrong and that <code>$$</code> means the session id. Wrong!</p>

<h2>terminfo / termcap</h2>

<p>These are packages that some programs like vi and less make use of for
gracefully switching in and out of screen-controlling modes; vi and less
take over the screen but when you quit, you see the terminal lines from
before you ran them. This uses terminfo, which is a terminal database
which provides facilities such as that.</p>

<h2>sigtstp</h2>

<p>You can catch a suspend ^Z via sigtstp and then signal sigstop to
actually stop the process, but any parent processes listening in will
think you were stopped by sigstop rather than sigtstp, so you can do the
more complicated thing of setting disposition to default, unblocking,
raising tstp (so that it suspends this time), and then resetting the
mask upon reentry.</p>

<h2><code>init</code> and <code>wait</code></h2>

<p>I originally thought that <code>init</code> would <code>wait</code> on every orphan it
inherited, but of course, <code>wait</code> is blocking if nothing&#8217;s actually
terminated, so I think <code>init</code> actually checks the status of the
process and <code>wait</code>s only if it&#8217;s terminated. But if it inherits a
stopped process group, it won&#8217;t call wait. So you might have stopped
process groups that live on forever and no one ever terminates them.</p>

<p>Hence, upon orphaning, the kernel sends SIGHUP + SIGCONT to any
orphaning process groups that have at least one stopped process, and
these signals are sent to everyone. Of course, at some later
post-orphaning time, these orphaned processes might be stopped and would
need <em>something</em> to come along and resume or terminate them.</p>

<h2>nice values</h2>

<p>You can give processes (specific pids, groups&#8217;, users&#8217;) varying nice
values from -20 to 19, give or take. Lower means higher priority, high
means lower.</p>

<h2>Security book recommendations</h2>

<p>The art of software security assessment</p>

<p>The grey hat hackers handbook</p>

<h2>Scheduling</h2>

<p>CPUs have their own run queues, with items with different priorities.
Processes can be scheduled with RR or FIFO real-time policy.</p>

<p><code>RR</code> is round robin. Equal priority processes get a time slice and then
get thrown in back of queue at the end. They can be pre-empted by higher
order shits. How?</p>

<ul>
<li>higher order process blocked on syscall becomes unblocked (io
available, etc)</li>
<li>another process raised to higher level</li>
<li>current process raised to lower value than some other process</li>
</ul>


<p><code>RR</code> similar to standard RR <code>SCHED_OTHER</code>, difference being in the
strictness of the weighting algorithm. <code>SCHED_OTHER</code> uses nice values,
but a lower nice value than another isn&#8217;t a strict determiner of
scheduling order, but rather a weighted suggestion, where as <code>RR</code> is
brutal deterministic.</p>

<p>In <code>FIFO</code> there&#8217;s no timeslice. You have it til you&#8217;re preempted or give
up control.</p>

<p>You can lock up a system with <code>RR</code> or <code>FIFO</code>. To prevent:</p>

<ul>
<li>set low CPU limit, which causes default-terminating <code>SIGXCPU</code> to fire.</li>
<li>use <code>alarm()</code></li>
<li>use high priority watchdog process to watch others, adjust their
priorities.</li>
</ul>


<p>CPU Affinity just means the tendency for a process/thread/kernel
scheduling unit to run on the same CPU; switching CPUs involves a slow
context switch, cache invalidation, etc.</p>

<h2>Daemonizing</h2>

<ul>
<li>long-running, often started at boot</li>
<li>has no controlling terminal (hence never receives INT, TSTP, HUP,
etc); its excluded from job-control signals</li>
</ul>


<p>some examples</p>

<ul>
<li>cron</li>
<li>sshd: the ssh server that&#8217;s open for remote logins.</li>
<li>httpd: http server

<ul>
<li>ah so TCP isn&#8217;t a daemon, it&#8217;s a kernel-level IO protocol, but httpd
is a server. It&#8217;s apache, duerp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>inetd: superserver daemon&#8230;? sounds like this doesn&#8217;t exist on mac.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some daemons run as kernel threads, w names bracketed.</p>

<p>To daemonize:</p>

<ul>
<li>fork: child process lives, master terminates.

<ul>
<li>returns control to terminal</li>
<li>child process lives on, and is no longer process group leader (it
inherits parent pgid which doesn&#8217;t match its new pid, so it can&#8217;t be
leader). this is needed for setsid (remember that setsid can&#8217;t be
called with process group leader, because other children processes
might be in that process group with a pgid pointing to a process
that lives in a different session, but process group members must
all live within the same session as a rule)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>setsid

<ul>
<li>become session leader

<ul>
<li>frees you from connected terminal</li>
<li>allows you to connect to another terminal (but&#8230; see below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fork again

<ul>
<li>this prevents any future terminals you connect to from becoming
controlling terminal (TODO: why/when would a daemon connect to a
terminal?)</li>
<li>you don&#8217;t have to do this if you don&#8217;t open another terminal, or you
open terminals with <code>O_NOCTTY</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clear umask (remember that umasks negate certain permissions on create
files&#8230; right? TODO: review this shit)</li>
<li>Change cwd to <code>/</code> so that in case the process was started with a cwd
on another file system that doesn&#8217;t contain <code>/</code>, that fs can be
unmounted

<ul>
<li>remember you can&#8217;t unmount &#8220;busy&#8221; FSs

<ul>
<li>files are open on it</li>
<li>processes have CWDs on it (how does it know? loop through the
processes?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Close all file descriptors, 0, 1, 2, for similar busy FD unmount
reasons, also because you might get some TTOUs if you try and read
from stdin.</li>
<li><code>dup2</code> them to point to <code>/dev/null</code> so that lib functions and other
things don&#8217;t unexpectedly file, or you don&#8217;t open another file in
their place but some lib function things they&#8217;re std IO and then write
shit to them

<ul>
<li>reading dev null yields EOF. PRETTY EFFIN HANDY</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Daemon shutdown consists of SIGTERM and a 5-second-layer SIGKILL if it
doesn&#8217;t clean up and shut down in that time (all processes concurrently
have 5 seconds to shutdown, not 5 seconds of CPU each; all SIGTERMS send
out at same time).</p>

<p>Memory leaks and fd leaks are a bigger deal for daemons since they&#8217;re so
long-lived.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to prevent multiple identical daemons from running;
Pidfiles help.</p>

<p>Logfiles can&#8217;t grow forever, and manually deleting a file if the daemon
doesn&#8217;t let go of it won&#8217;t prevent the resources from being freed until
the last handle is closed to the file. <code>logrotate()</code> can be used to aid
in this.</p>

<p>HUP is unused since daemons don&#8217;t have controlling terminals so people
classically use it to re-initialize or reload conf files.</p>

<p>Btw you can open other people&#8217;s TTYs. And it means you can write to
their screens.</p>

<p><code>syslog</code> and <code>syslogd</code> is a useful utility to global logging; write to
syslog unix domain datagram socket and blah dee blah dee blah it&#8217;ll
funnel out to wherever based on a shared conf FILE!</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Privilege via</p>

<ul>
<li>root started it</li>
<li>set-user-id or set-group-id + owned by root</li>
</ul>


<p>Guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>don&#8217;t use set-user/group-id unless you really need it; better to
use a child process

<ul>
<li>or if you need it, don&#8217;t give it root</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e.g. a process currently with set-user-id that allows unprivileged
users to write to a file they don&#8217;t have access to: much better to
set-group-id to a group specific to this process, and set group of
that file to that group. group. group. group.</li>
<li>if you&#8217;re set-user-id, only operate in that mode when you need it.</li>
<li>real id is whoever started the program</li>
<li>basically, shit is really hard and you should refer to this book every
time you need a refresher because this stuff megasucks.</li>
<li>don&#8217;t exec shells or other interpreters when you have privileges. Way
way way too open to abuse.</li>
<li>close file handlers; they&#8217;re just integers, not hard to reuse. recall
CLOEXEC</li>
</ul>


<h2>Clear out your memory</h2>

<p>Why? Because it might be paged out to a swap area that privileged
programs can read. So that seems pretty iScare. If that&#8217;s visible, why
not fuckin, fuckin, fuckin memory, man, why can&#8217;t you like open another
process and look at its memory maaaan, even without it having been paged
first.</p>

<p>Actually you can if you&#8217;re not careful. You can create special device
files that have direct access to RAM. That&#8217;s so fucking crazy. So even
<code>chroot</code> can&#8217;t even save you if you have a set-user-id-root program.
Crazy crazy crazy.</p>

<p>Also if you have a leftover open file handle to <code>/</code> then you can
<code>fchdir</code> into it and <code>chroot(".")</code> chroot back into that shiot.</p>

<h2>Use capabilities</h2>

<p>UNIX privileges are all-or-nothing; Linux adds the notion of
capabilities. Use em. They&#8217;re granular n shit.</p>

<h2>Use virtual kernels</h2>

<p>Totally isolated. They have no concept of the raw kernel. Can&#8217;t access
it. Can&#8217;t do shiot.</p>

<p>BSD <code>jail()</code> addresses lots of this stuff. SO MANY FUCKING LOOP HOLES OH
MY GOD.</p>

<h2>Time of check, time of use</h2>

<p><code>access()</code> lets you query access of user to file. If you&#8217;re
set-id-to-root and you check if some unprivileged user has access to
something, maybe a symlink, and then in between that check and whatever
you end up destructively doing, the symlink is swapped to elsewhere,
then you might clobber some shittles. Malicious user could go nutso and
fire off a bunch of <code>SIGSTOP</code>s and change runtime environment to fuck
with a privileged program.</p>

<h2>Bounds checking</h2>

<p>strcpy babeh</p>

<p>Linux now has stack address randomization which randomizes the location
of the stack in an 8 MB range in VM. Seems cool. That&#8217;s why if you print
the pointer of a var int main in a test C program, it&#8217;s different each
run. This feels similar to stretches in bcrypt and any other security
measure that makes certain operations slower to counteract brute force
attackers.</p>

<h2>DoS denial of service</h2>

<p>Local variants include fork bombing.</p>

<p>Remote DoS more common, combat w:</p>

<ul>
<li>load throttling, dropping requests when overloaded</li>
<li>timeouts</li>
<li>(throttled) logging of overloads</li>
<li>don&#8217;t crash from unexpected loads</li>
<li>avoid algorithmic complexity attacks wherein a structure known to
handle a particular series of input might get fucked and consume lots
of resources. Not insecure, necessarily, but might fuck the fuck.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Shared libs</h2>

<p>Compile w <code>-g</code> nowadays since RAM and disk are cheap. Apparently this
info doesn&#8217;t affect performance?</p>

<p>A shared lib is a <code>.a</code> file composed of <code>.o</code> files, constructed with
<code>ar</code>, as in &#8220;library archives&#8221;.</p>

<pre><code>$ ar tv /usr/lib/liby.a
rw-r--r--       0/0            40 Aug 24 21:45 2013 __.SYMDEF SORTED
rw-r--r--       0/0           920 Aug 24 21:45 2013 main.o
rw-r--r--       0/0           912 Aug 24 21:45 2013 yyerror.o
</code></pre>

<p>Variants of <code>gcc</code> and static libs</p>

<pre><code># generate wat.o
gcc -c wat.c

# generate a.out with wat.o lib
gcc lol.c wat.o otherlibarchive.a

# search standard lib directories (like /usr/lib)
# looks for /usr/lib/libwoot.a
gcc -c wat.c -lwoot

# Search a non-standard directory
gcc -c wat.c -lwoot -L/borflex/snaggletooth
</code></pre>

<p>All of the .a archive and .o object files is added to executable size.
Seems bad. Also when the processes are run, VM is increased by that
much, even though it&#8217;s all redundant read-only text shit.</p>

<p>Ah. Static libs. vs Shared libs. Shared libs are fuckin, fuckin,
dynamic, maaaan.</p>

<p>Ah note that static and global variables obviously aren&#8217;t shared between
shared libs; each process gets a copy.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Large shared libs between small processes mean quicker process startup
time (though the first time the shared lib is loaded into VM is
obviously slow)</li>
<li>With some limitations, you can swap out libs without relinking</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>complexity</li>
<li>shared libs must use position-independent code

<ul>
<li>PIC is a way of compiling shared libs so that the location of
functions, statics, globals, string constants, etc, can vary, and I
don&#8217;t understand it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Modern shared lib linking format is ELF: Executable and Linking Format.</p>

<p><code>.so</code> is shared object, shared lib, as opposed to just <code>.o</code>.</p>

<p><code>ar</code> lets you add/remove <code>.o</code>s from library archives, but not so with
<code>.so</code>s.</p>

<p>You can use <code>nm</code> (name list util, i.e. symbol table util) to list
symbols.</p>

<p>Interesting, so given the following <code>wat.c</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int WAT;
</code></pre>

<p>I see <code>_WAT</code> appear in the symbol table:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc -c wat.c &amp;&amp; nm wat.o
0000000000000004 C _WAT
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it wouldn&#8217;t appear if I&#8217;d made it <code>static</code> or <code>extern</code>. Shit
is cool.</p>

<p>So PIC adds a global offset table to help the dynamic linking describe
where shit is.</p>

<p>Hmm what if I use <code>g++</code> on a cpp file?</p>

<pre><code>$ g++ -c wat.cpp &amp;&amp; nm wat.o
0000000000000000 S _WAT
</code></pre>

<p>What&#8217;s the difference b/w S and C? C apparently means &#8220;common&#8221; symbol,
and S means a generic &#8220;none of the above&#8221; in the <code>man nm</code>.</p>

<p>You can take a dynamic/shared lib and compile statically though, if you
want it:</p>

<ul>
<li>less complexity</li>
<li>safer against .so upgrades</li>
</ul>


<p>So what&#8217;s the difference between a .so and a .dylib? Is that a mac
thing?</p>

<h2>Dynamically loaded libraries</h2>

<p>Deferred loading whenever some plugin is loaded. As in your code does
it. Seems pretty rad. Use <code>dlopen</code>. Search a function by name, invoke
it.</p>

<p>You can use env var <code>LD_DEBUG</code> to print out some shit.</p>

<h2>IPC</h2>

<ul>
<li>byte streams: pipes, fifos, datagram sockets</li>
<li>message: message queues; can&#8217;t read them part way, all or nothing</li>
<li>pseudoterminals</li>
</ul>


<p>Different from shared mem:</p>

<ul>
<li>reads are destructive for byte streams (but yes in some cases you can
seek, multicast/broadcast)</li>
</ul>


<p>MQ (POSIX or SystemV) messages have priorities, and deliver in different
order.</p>

<p>Ah now it&#8217;s coming back to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>UNIX domain sockets

<ul>
<li>ruby: <code>Socket.pair</code></li>
<li>datagram (no need to worry about byte streams/delimiters)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pipe

<ul>
<li>ruby: <code>IO.pipe</code></li>
<li>stream</li>
<li>flow control handled by kernel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pipes and FIFOs</h2>

<p>Pipes are old as SHIT. Oldest method of IPC, since 3rd edition of UNIX
in early 1970s.</p>

<p>THAT&#8217;s what that dude meant. Pipes vs Sockets. We use pipes, not
sockets.</p>

<p>Pipes are constrained to related processes, FIFOs can talk between all
processes.</p>

<p>Pipes are unidirectional.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t reorder data, can&#8217;t random access w lseek.</p>

<p>Writes up to <code>PIPE_BUF</code> are atomic, Linux has <code>PIPE_BUF</code> at 4096. If
larger, kernel might break into pieces. This means that if you have two
processes writing more than <code>PIPE_BUF</code>, the final stream might be
interleaved with both messages (both processes will still be blocked on
<code>write</code> until everything is flushed out).</p>

<p>Partial writes can occur if a write larger than <code>PIPE_BUF</code> is
interrupted by a signal handler, and call comes back with the number of
bytes written. Pretty cool. Makes sense.</p>

<p>Writes will block if kernel buffer is full.</p>

<p>Pipes only work b/w related processes, which mean they must have a
common fork ancestor. Apparently there&#8217;s another way to pass file
descriptors. But I guess it&#8217;d need translating? Because there are
descriptors and open file descriptions, and the descriptor ints are
different between shits.</p>

<p>SIGPIPE is ignored by default, but when you write to broken pipe you get
SIGPIPE and EPIPE. Such pipe.</p>

<p><code>popen</code> runs a shell command, letting you establish a single pipe,
either r or w.</p>

<p>FIFOs are like pipes except that they&#8217;re special files in th file
system. Opening a read-only FIFO blocks until someone writes, and vice
versa.</p>

<p><code>tee(1)</code> writes to stdio AND some other file, which could be a fifo. So
you can split a stream and send it to other things. Pretty cool.</p>

<p>UNRELATED: <code>bash -c "sleep 5"</code> execs sleep 5; it doesn&#8217;t create a bash
process and then fork again, it just straight up execs. Whereas when
you&#8217;re running interactive bash, all commands are forked and then
exec&#8217;d.</p>

<p>Trick with IPC w servers is that there needs to be some known file name,
which opens the door to exploitation if you&#8217;re not careful.
FIFOs (and pipes) are byte streams (rather than unix domain datagram
sockets) so you have to</p>

<ol>
<li>Use some EOM delimiter</li>
<li>Message length header</li>
<li>Fixed message size</li>
</ol>


<p>and on top of all of that everything needs to be less than the pipe
buffer size constant or else kernel might interleave messages.</p>

<p>Pipes provide synchronization by e.g. opening a pipe, forking, having
the parent blocked on a <code>read()</code> until child processes have all done
their shit and closed their end of the pipe.</p>

<p><code>popen</code> has the same considerations as <code>system</code>.</p>

<h2>System V</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V</p>

<p>One of first commercial versions of UNIX, from 1983. Today&#8217;s descendants
are AIX, Solaris, and HP-UX.</p>

<p>System V IPC</p>

<ul>
<li>MQs

<ul>
<li>delivered in order, but each message has type, so can be selected
out of order</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Semaphores

<ul>
<li>kernel forbids it from going below 0, sync technique</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shared mem</li>
</ul>


<p>w System V IPC you create objects (like files but unlike files). Objects
have ids, but unlike fd&#8217;s, these are system wide.</p>

<p>Semaphores don&#8217;t error when you subtract below zero; rather the kernel
will block if you try and subtract, and it&#8217;ll come back alive when
someone increments.</p>

<h2>Considered Harmful</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful</p>

<p>Popular phrase originating from &#8220;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&#8221;, a
Djikstra thing.</p>

<h2>mmap</h2>

<p>Memory mapping can either use</p>

<ul>
<li>real files</li>
<li>anonymous zero-d out files</li>
</ul>


<p>Both are shareable between processes. By:</p>

<ul>
<li>mmapping to the same region of the same file</li>
<li>forking with a previously established handle to a</li>
</ul>


<p>Mapping to same file can be configured:</p>

<ul>
<li>private: writes don&#8217;t go through to file, so process changes to the
mapping are isolated from each other. Implemented by copy-on-write.</li>
<li>shared: durp</li>
</ul>


<h2>dev zero</h2>

<p><code>/dev/zero</code> gives you null bytes. Forever!</p>

<h2>dev urandom</h2>

<p>Write seeds, read values.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t perfect but kinda works:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e 'puts File.open("/dev/urandom").gets(4).unpack("l")'
</code></pre>

<p>Extra credit if you can figure out what that ain&#8217;t right</p>

<h2>Get off the aaaaaaair I&#8217;m in the STEREO</h2>

<p><code>mmap</code> can overcommit swap space due to lazy committal. Useful for
implementing things like sparse arrays (a large array might only access
bits and pieces, and if separate by a page.</p>

<pre><code>$ getconf PAGESIZE
4096
</code></pre>

<p>Daatz cool. So if you have a bajillion thingeroo and it&#8217;s allocated on a
shit, then woooop there it is.</p>

<p>Overcommitals can ran the system out of memory at which point the kernel
starts killin&#8217; shit. The kernel code that does this is the OOM
Out-of-Memory killer.</p>

<p>OOM kills with <code>SIGKILL</code>, you can look at your score with a special file
in procfs.</p>

<h2>dscacheutil</h2>

<p>Directory Service Cache Utility. Supercedes <code>lookupd</code>.</p>

<h2>VM operations</h2>

<ul>
<li>protect: set read/write protections on a VM page

<ul>
<li>applies to mmapped files, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mlock and mlockall: keep memory in RAM; useful since an attack vector
would be to consume lots of RAM, forcing some processes to write to
disk, and then reading from the swap space.

<ul>
<li>then again, suspend mode in laptops/desktops copied ram to disk, so
you&#8217;re effed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>traceroute UDP vs ICMP</h2>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t work</p>

<pre><code>traceroute machty.com
</code></pre>

<p>This does</p>

<pre><code>traceroute -I machty.com
</code></pre>

<p>because it uses ICMP ECHO rather than a UDP packet (which I guess gets
dropped somewhere along the way? tis a Rackspace github pages HTTP
server so UDP wouldn&#8217;t make sense anyway), and ICMP ECHOs I guess are
considered more sensible and friendly?</p>

<p>I realized this was the issue since <code>ping machty.com</code>, which uses ICMP
ECHO, works just fine.</p>

<h2>Power of Attorney</h2>

<p>Written authorized permission for one person to act on behalf of
another, even if the other disagrees. Relevant in the legal sense, as
well as health care decisions up to and including terminating care and
life support.</p>

<h2>Darwin, Mach, OS X</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system">Darwin wiki</a>)</p>

<p>Darwin is an an open source operating system released by Apple in 2000</p>

<ul>
<li>Composed of NeXSTEP, BSD, other freeware</li>
<li>Largely compatible with POSIX but not certified.</li>
<li>SUSv3-compatible</li>
<li>Kernel is XNU

<ul>
<li>&#8220;X is Not Unix&#8221; - stupidest naming scheme ever</li>
<li>Hybrid kernel

<ul>
<li>Combo of micro and monolithic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_kernel</li>
<li>Micro kernels are often &lt; 10,000 lines of code, do the bare
minimum, put more things into user space (or at least a higher
privilege ring)</li>
<li>Linus thinks hybrid is just monolithic and that it&#8217;s all just
marketing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combo of Mach (microkernel) + aspects of BSD (monolithic kernel)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closed source Cocoa et al frameworks are missing, so it can&#8217;t run mac
applications</li>
</ul>


<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel</p>

<p>So I guess OS X is Darwin + Cocoa and a bunch of other layers.</p>

<h2>POSIX IPC</h2>

<ul>
<li>Simular to System V</li>
<li>API closer to classic UNIX everything-is-a-file abstraction</li>
<li>Simpler API in general</li>
</ul>


<h2>Semaphores: portable?</h2>

<p>Does anyone use operating system semaphores in open source? I mostly see
sockets and forking and what not for IPC in server code; does anyone
use semaphores?</p>

<p>Answer: yes, libuv does (the async IO lib that Node uses). I&#8217;m sure
plenty of other people do too.</p>

<h2>Node copies in all dependencies</h2>

<p>The Node repo doesn&#8217;t use submodules or anything like that; literally
the entire codebase of a dependency, whether v8 or libuv, is copied into
the <code>/deps</code> folder.</p>

<h2>WATCHLISTS</h2>

<p>Something to Chromium devs use that mark certain portions of code as of
interest to some reviewer, presumably to prevent undesirables from
getting into the system.</p>

<p>https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/deps/v8/WATCHLISTS</p>

<h2>File locking</h2>

<p>Used for synchronization. Could use semaphores but the kernel already
has file locking so why not use that for files?</p>

<p>stdio lib might cause issues with buffers and locks, so either follow
some rules about immediately flushing, or just skip stdio and use <code>read</code>
and <code>write</code>, or disable the buffering.</p>

<p>Locks apply to open file descriptions (in the shared open file table in
the kernel), not descriptors, so if you dup the descriptor and
explicitly unlock it, it applies to all duplicates (it doesn&#8217;t maintain
a count or anything).</p>

<p>You can only hold a lock associated with an fd. So if all fds are
closed, the lock is unlocked.</p>

<p>If you fork a lock, then it only takes one unlock (parent or child) to
release the lock. Wacky shiznittletons. But this lends to the pattern of
&#8220;parent establishes lock, forks, and closes file descriptor so that only
the child has the lock and open fd&#8221;.</p>

<p>Locks are preserved across exec unless close-on-exec on the fd and the
fd was the last one associated with the description.</p>

<p><code>flock()</code> downsides:</p>

<ul>
<li>only whole files lockable, hamper concurrency if processes would be
otherwise able to write to the same file in separate sections</li>
<li>can only place advisory locks.

<ul>
<li>advisory locks mean the kernel doesn&#8217;t actually help prevent
reads/writes; processes could ignore advisory locks and perform IO
anyway. Mandatory locks on the other hand&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Record locking with fcntl</h2>

<p><code>fcntl</code> allows record-locking: locking anywhere from a byte to whole
file. &#8220;record-locking&#8221; might be the wrong word since files are just byte
streams with no concept of &#8220;records&#8221; beyond what their consuming
processes decide.</p>

<p><code>fcntl</code> just stands for &#8220;file control&#8221;. I get it confused with <code>ioctl</code>.
<code>fcntl</code> is control over descriptors in a process. Basically <code>fcntl</code>
behaves almost like a kernel sys call in that it&#8217;s just setting an
integer of the command you want to perform followed by varying numbers
of arguments based on the command. So you can do arbtrary, extensible
stuff that might not already be neatly contained within some other
single purpose wrapper fn.</p>

<p>SUSv3 requires record locking for regular files and permits record
locking for other file types even if it doesn&#8217;t really make sense.</p>

<p>Write locks are exclusive (to both read and write locks). Read locks
are not (they can be shared). Nothing new here.</p>

<p><code>fcntl</code> locking works by passing <code>flock</code> structure. You can lock
relative to current file pointer.</p>

<p><code>BADF</code> if you try and read/write lock a file on a file not open for
reading/writing.</p>

<p><code>len</code> of 0 means lock from whence onward (even if bytes are added to the
file).</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlocking always immediately succeeds.</li>
<li>different sections can be locked with different types</li>
<li>locks can be split by e.g. placing a write lock in the middle of a
larger range of read locks (3 locked regions are produced)</li>
</ul>


<p>The kernel prevents deadlocks between processes. (Similar rules apply
with thread mutexes). Chooses one of the processes and unblocks fcntl
with errno <code>EDEADLK</code>. Even circular deadlocks are detected. Pretty cool.</p>

<p>fcntl locking semantics:</p>

<ul>
<li>locks not inherited cross fork()</li>
<li>locks are inherited</li>
<li>threads share record locks</li>
<li>Record locks are pid+inodenum, so, weirdly, if you close an fd, all of
its locks are released, even if they came from other fds. Kind of
crazy? (This is architectural weak sauce; should have been file
handler rather than inode, but it&#8217;s now standardized).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mandatory Locking</h2>

<p>File system must be mounted with mandatory locking enabled. And it must
be enabled on a per-file basis by enabling set-group-id and disabling
group execute permission. This yields a capital S in <code>ls -l</code> if you&#8217;ve
done it right.</p>

<ul>
<li>most file systems support it, cept for things like VFAT which don&#8217;t
have the required permission bits</li>
<li>locked file can still be deleted</li>
<li>privileges processes can&#8217;t override a mandatory lock. A malicious user
holding on to a well known public file is a form of DOS attack.</li>
<li>mandatory locks has performance hit against IO</li>
</ul>


<p>Probably best avoided?</p>

<p>tmpfs <code>/proc/locks</code> is useful.</p>

<h2>Pidfile</h2>

<p>Create a file and place write lock on it. Any other instances will try
and do the same thing, fail, and terminate under the assumption that a
running process already has a lock on it. Alternate approaches for
networked apps use bound ports to make this same decision.</p>

<p>Often such things live in <code>/var/run</code>. Conventional to write pid to file
and use extension <code>.pid</code>.</p>

<p>You can CLOEXEC a pidfile since some servers reinitialize themselves by
<code>exec</code>ing themselves. Seems crazy?</p>

<h2>Sockets</h2>

<ul>
<li>exist in communication domain

<ul>
<li>determines how socket is identified (form of &#8220;address&#8221;)</li>
<li>range of communication (intra-computer, internet, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple domains of sockets

<ul>
<li>UNIX domain: <code>AF_UNIX</code>. Communication b/w processes on same host
(all within the kernel)</li>
<li>IP (v4 and v6)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><code>PF_UNIX</code> vs <code>AF_UNIX</code> constants: Protocol Family vs Address Family:
often synonomous, but different due to intent to support protocols
having multiple families of addresses, but this hasn&#8217;t happened.</p>

<p>Every socket impl can be stream or datagram oriented.</p>

<p>Stream socket
- &#8220;reliable&#8221;&#8230;? UNIX Domain streaming sockets? Curious to know what the overlap is with TCP.
- bi-directional, as if a pair of pipes had been established.</p>

<h3>socket()</h3>

<p>Create a socket with</p>

<ul>
<li>domain: UNIX, IPv4, IPv6</li>
<li>type: STREAM vs DATAGRAM</li>
<li>protocol (usually 0 unless you&#8217;re doing funky things with raw sockets</li>
</ul>


<h3>bind()</h3>

<ul>
<li>Binds to an address / port</li>
<li>is actually <em>optional</em>: if you don&#8217;t call <code>bind()</code> you&#8217;ll use an
ephemeral port chosen by the kernel. Though this means you&#8217;d need to
use some other mechanism for publishing.</li>
</ul>


<h3>stream sockets</h3>

<ul>
<li>socket() creates</li>
<li>server

<ul>
<li>bind()s to a specific port/address</li>
<li>listen()s, signalling the kernel that it&#8217;s ready to accept</li>
<li>accept()s to actually process a connection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>clients connects()</li>
<li>both can send(), recv(), write(), read(), etc</li>
</ul>


<p>Stream sockets can be active or passive</p>

<ul>
<li>active: can be used in a connect() call

<ul>
<li>usually clients</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>passive: has been marked to <code>listen()</code> for connections

<ul>
<li>usually servers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>listen(int sockfd, int backlog)</h3>

<p>Tell the kernel to start listening for connections. <code>backlog</code> is the
number of connections you&#8217;re willing to have in a pending state before
<code>accept()</code> is called.</p>

<h3>accept()</h3>

<p>Blocks til connection arrives.</p>

<ul>
<li>creates a <em>new</em> socket, the one that you can actually perform IO on
that makes it to the peer socket.

<ul>
<li>so why are they both called sockets? one that&#8217;s used for a
establishing connections, and another that&#8217;s used within an
established connection?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>connect()</h3>

<ul>
<li>if it fails, close socket, create a new one, try again</li>
</ul>


<h3>Stream socket IO</h3>

<p>Sockets are bi-directional, which means kernel must internally maintain
two buffers, one for each direction.</p>

<p>Writing into already-closed UNIX domain socket yields SIGPIPE/EPIPE.</p>

<p>For UNIX-domain sockets, if a <code>close</code> fails to propagate or some other
shit goes down (eg a crash), then we have no way of knowing; should
build some sort of ACK into the system (or just use TCP?).</p>

<p>(then again with TCP, what&#8217;s the API for knowing that a specific write
failed? Usually you write and then move on, right? Or do all write&#8217;s
block? Seems weird brah)</p>

<h3>Datagram flow</h3>

<ul>
<li>create socket w socket()</li>
<li>bind() to known address</li>
<li>sendto() to send a datagram</li>
<li>recvfrom() to recv (the from implies that the source address will be
included in the thing)</li>
<li>close() when socket no longer needed</li>
</ul>


<p><code>recvfrom</code> takes a length, returns a single datagram, silently truncating
if less than <code>length</code>. <code>recvmsg</code> is a variant that sets <code>MSG_TRUNC</code> if
truncation occurred.</p>

<h3>Datagram <code>connect()</code></h3>

<p>Seemingly at oods with the known properties of datagram sockets, you can
actually use <code>connect</code> w dgram socks to yield a &#8220;connected datagram
socket&#8221;. This does a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>allows you to use <code>write</code> and <code>read</code> (rather than having to pass the
address in to <code>sendto</code> and <code>recvfrom</code> all the live long day)</li>
<li>only messages from the socket peer can be <code>read</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>UNIX Domain Sockets</h2>

<p>For bidirectionality you always have to create a pair.</p>

<p>You can create a UNIX domain socket via other means by providing a file
name. You must have permissions to create this thing, and it&#8217;s a special
file of <code>stat</code> time <code>IFSOCK</code></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s do some ruby</p>

<pre><code>require 'socket'
socket = Socket.new(:UNIX, :DGRAM)

# recall that pack_sockaddr_in refers to internet, `un` refers to UNIX
# address becomes a null-packed string. The Ruby socket lib is
# actually pretty low level when it comes to this shit.
address = Socket.pack_sockaddr_un('./wat.unix.socket') 

# this will actually create a special file in the directory
socket.bind(address)
</code></pre>

<p>Verify it&#8217;s a special file (lf -F puts <code>/</code> at the end of directories and
<code>=</code> at the end of sockets). Recall that this requires directory search
permissions since it needs to read the contents of the inode rather than
just the name of the files.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -F ./wat.unix.socket
./wat.unix.socket=
</code></pre>

<p>Note the starting &#8220;s&#8221;:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l ./wat.unix.socket
srwxr-xr-x  1 machty  staff  0 Oct 26 17:57 ./wat.unix.socket
</code></pre>

<p>Also you can&#8217;t open a socket like a normal file:</p>

<pre><code>f = File.open('./wat.unix.socket')
Errno::EOPNOTSUPP: Operation not supported on socket - ./wat.unix.socket
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you tried to bind to this socket again, you&#8217;d get
EADDRINUSE. This is interesting since you always see this error in the
context of IP address/port collisions, but in this case it&#8217;s a file
pathname; that&#8217;s because address is a generic concept, the specifics of
which are dependent on which socket domain you&#8217;re using</p>

<ul>
<li>IPv4/IPv6 addresses are IP addresses</li>
<li>UNIX is pathnames</li>
</ul>


<p>Both are packed into that address struct so that sys calls can
use/expect the same struct blob.</p>

<p>STREAM sockets have active and passive. <code>passive</code> has had <code>listen()</code>
called on it.</p>

<p>I still am unclear about whether sockets are bi-directional. I think
they are. But I don&#8217;t understand how to stop blocking on <code>read()</code>. Like,
does it block until the buffer is full? I&#8217;ll figure it out later.</p>

<p>Datagrams are supposed to be unreliable, possibly delivered twice, etc,
but UNIX domain datagrams are reliable since it&#8217;s just the kernel
delivering shit (it&#8217;s only difficult to guarantee reliability over a
network). So UNIX domain datagrams are delivered in order and not
duplicated.</p>

<p>Linux allows large datagrams, but some UNIX buffers might only be 2048,
so if you&#8217;re going for portable, go for small.</p>

<p>AHHH fucking dummy, I was using the wrong ruby method. <code>IO#read</code> reads
until you&#8217;ve filled a buffer (or EOF). What you want is <code>read_nonblock</code>.
&#8220;But why do you still need to pass a max len&#8230; this is ruby it can
handle whatever&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, probably because it ultimately translates
to a syscall which needs the length? Yes I think I&#8217;m right about this
after consulting <code>io.c</code> in MRI.</p>

<h2>Socket pairs</h2>

<p><code>socketpair()</code> or <code>Socket.pair</code> returns a pair of connected sockets.
Communication is bi-directional. Benefits over manually creating this
pair include not having to have a public address. Useful for forky IPC.
Very similar to pipe approach to fork IPC cept that pipes are
unidirectional.</p>

<pre><code>require 'socket.rb'
a,b = Socket.pair(:UNIX, :DGRAM)

a.write("bullshit\n")
puts b.read_nonblock(100)
b.write("horseass\n")
puts a.read_nonblock(100)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this example works also if we used <code>:STREAM</code>.</p>

<h2>Internet domain sockets</h2>

<p>Unlike UNIX domain datagram, internet domain datagrams (implemented on
UDP) are</p>

<ul>
<li>Unreliable, might be delivered twice or not at all.</li>
<li>Sending doesn&#8217;t block if client buffer full, just dropped silently.</li>
</ul>


<p>Network byte order is big-endian.</p>

<p>Marshalling is tricky, dealing with endianness and what not. Converting
to text is often the easiest way to make sense of things, can debug w
<code>telnet</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Clients generally don&#8217;t <code>bind()</code> when making connections / sending
datagrams, in which case the kernel provides an ephemeral port.</p>

<h2>DNS</h2>

<p>Types of requests:</p>

<ul>
<li>recursive: server handles entire task of resolution, including talking
with other DNS servers. I believe though that once you&#8217;ve made the
request, the server can make an iterative approach</li>
<li>iterative: ask <code>.</code> for <code>com.</code>, <code>com.</code> NS for <code>machty.com.</code>,
<code>machty.com.</code> NS for <code>www.machty.com.</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s a local DNS server (<code>named</code> for Linux) that you can ask for
names, and it&#8217;ll do iterative. You ask it for recursive and it does
iterative.</p>

<p>Root name servers found via <code>dig . NS</code>, e.g. &#8220;gimme all the Name Server
entries for the root domain <code>.</code>.</p>

<p><code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> configures the DNS resolver, defines how partial
domain names are resolved (they get concatted with the <code>domain</code> entry in
<code>resolve.conf</code>.</p>

<pre><code># assuming `domain home`
ssh machty # machty.home
ssh machty.home
</code></pre>

<p>Both work. But this is just a local DNS nicety, not the distributed DNS
whitchajigger.</p>

<h2>TLDs</h2>

<p>First layer of nodes immediately under the root <code>.</code> node. Two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>generic: com, edu, net, org:</li>
<li>country: co, de:</li>
</ul>


<h2>ports</h2>

<p><code>/etc/services</code> maintains known port names.</p>

<h2>getsockname</h2>

<p>This is useful when you&#8217;re using ephemeral ports (listen without
bind).</p>

<pre><code>require 'socket'
s = Socket.net(:INET, :STREAM)
s.listen(5)
s.puts s.local_address.ip_port
</code></pre>

<p><code>local_address</code> is a wrapper around <code>s.getsockname</code>, which is some null
padded garbage. For UNIX domain sockets it&#8217;ll contain the file pathname.</p>

<p>This is the difference between sockets bound at 127.0.0.1:45454 and
0.0.0.0:45455, which shows that both the local ip and port are
represented in getsockname.</p>

<pre><code>=&gt; "\x10\x02\xB1\x8E\x7F\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
=&gt; "\x10\x02\xB1\x8F\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
</code></pre>

<h2>UDP ephemeral port server</h2>

<p>So, <code>listen()</code> on a STREAM server will implicitly perform an ephemeral
port bind if you haven&#8217;t explicitly called <code>bind()</code> already; is it
possible to make an ephemeral UDP server, wherein the port is
ephemerally decided by the kernel? Well, yes, but you have to call bind;
the trick is to call it with port 0 to signify the kernel should pick
one for you. Why would you do this? I don&#8217;t know; probably if you wanted
some anonymous service that no attacker could guess the port of ahead of
time? But you&#8217;d still need to advertise your port somehow.</p>

<h2>UNIX v internet domain sockets</h2>

<ul>
<li>UNIX faster on some implementations</li>
<li>UNIX DGRAM delivery is reliable</li>
<li>UNIX lets you use file permissions for authentication</li>
<li>UNIX lets you pass open file descriptors when forking, etc</li>
</ul>


<p>But often internet sockets are the way to go since they work locally and
remotely.</p>

<h2>Load-balancing with DNS</h2>

<p>If you provide multiple IPs to the same DNS record, you get round-robin
resolution, babeh.</p>

<h2>inetd; inet daemon</h2>

<p>If you have infrequently used daemons that would hog a process table
entry and resources, why not give their sockets to inetd and inetd will
spin up your servers when they need them.</p>

<ul>
<li>number of processes reduced</li>
<li>inetd does the server-y stuff that its clients would otherwise have to
write.</li>
</ul>


<p>aka internet superserver.</p>

<h2>Who responds to ICMP messages?</h2>

<p>Just routers/gateways. Not apps, unless you&#8217;re opening raw sockets n shit.</p>

<p>For instance you can&#8217;t spin up a rails server on localhost:3000 and
expect <code>ping localhost:3000</code> to work, because it&#8217;s only listening to
TCP/UDP sockets. AHHHH I am saying so much ignorance: here&#8217;s the truth:</p>

<p>ICMP has no concept of port. Port is TCP/UDP concept. ALWAYS REMEMBER
THAT. ICMP is IP-only. Whatever responds to / notices an incoming ICMP
request must only have an IP address, and not expect to use a port in
any way. So gateways/hosts/routers will respond to ICMP. You can ping
your router. You can ping gateways. You can traceroute all the way to a
website. And you can ping localhost, because loopback is a gateway.</p>

<p>So how can you write a program that listens for ICMP requests? You need
a raw socket, which requires sudo:</p>

<pre><code>require 'socket'
require 'base64'

rsock = Socket.new(:INET, :RAW)

loop do
  s = rsock.recv(1024)
  enc = Base64.encode64(s)
  puts enc
end
</code></pre>

<p>Again, no concept of port; there&#8217;s no <code>bind</code> here nor does the kernel
assign an ephemeral port; it&#8217;s all raw sockets babeh.</p>

<p>From <code>ping(8)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>The ping utility uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to
elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>ping</code> pings gateways/hosts, not servers.</p>

<h2>ECONNREFUSED</h2>

<p>This is caused by ICMP, if it decides it wants to send anything. Shit
gets dropped.</p>

<h2>MTU: Maximum Transmission Unit</h2>

<p>This is what causes IP packets to be sliced and diced.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit</p>

<p>The min MTU between two endpoints is the path MTU. The minimum allowable
MTU is well-defined, I forget what it is, but I think there&#8217;s one
guaranteed by IP.</p>

<p>You can find the path MTU (per TCP/UDP RFC) by setting do not fragment
flag and seeing if ICMP sends back a failure due to datagram size. That
said, lots of gateways silently drop ICMP to prevent DoS:</p>

<pre><code>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_(networking)
</code></pre>

<p>People might black hole to prevent pings; you can still send well formed
TCP/UDP requests but it won&#8217;t respond to ICMP <code>ECHO_REQUEST</code>s or
anything like that.</p>

<h2>Packet-switching</h2>

<blockquote><p>Packet switching is a digital networking communications method that groups all transmitted data – regardless of content, type, or structure – into suitably sized blocks, called packets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Switching I believe is how two endpoints of a physical link decide how
to send data between each other; they could either do circuit switching
and have a dedicated connection until the connection was over,
or you can packet switch, whereby you
break the communication into small packets that send all at once (and IP
might slice them to fit the link&#8217;s MTU).</p>

<h2>C Standard Library</h2>

<p>I was confused for a moment about where <code>write()</code> and <code>read()</code> and these
low level syscall wrappers lived&#8230; were they considered part of the C
standard library? Or were they in some bare-bones thing in some other
category of code that operating systems provided?</p>

<p>Naw, it&#8217;s all C Standard Library. It&#8217;s just that (I think) <code>write</code> and
<code>read</code> are so low level as to not be considered part of <code>stdio</code>, the IO
subset of the C standard lib.</p>
