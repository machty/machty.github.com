		<h2>netcat (nc)</h2>

<p>Utility to spinning up arbitrary tcp servers for testing, sending
packets, etc.</p>

<pre><code>Socket.new(Socket::AF_INET, Socket::SOCK_STREAM)
or symbols:
Socket.new(:INET6, :STREAM)
</code></pre>

<p>INET = internet, specifically IPv4, <code>SOCK_STREAM</code> means a TCP stream
will be set up, as opposed to <code>DGRAM</code>, which would set up UDP.</p>

<p>Set up bullshit listener:</p>

<pre><code>nc -l localhost 4481
</code></pre>

<h2>Loopback</h2>

<p><code>localhost</code> is a loopback, which is a virtual interface where any data
sent to the loopback is immediately received. <code>127.0.0.1</code> is the IP.</p>

<p>Check dat <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
</code></pre>

<p>Funny how I never notice stuff like that until someone officially
defines it for me.</p>

<h2>&#8220;well-known&#8221; ports</h2>

<p>Hosted by IANA.org, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.</p>

<h2>Gerrymandering</h2>

<blockquote><p>manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favor one party or class.</p></blockquote>

<p>Knew what this was, forgot the word for it.</p>

<h2>AWS Spot Instances</h2>

<p>Running interruption-tolerant applications on EC2 unused capacity, where
you can bid on price per hour and maximum bid price.</p>

<h2>Chekhov&#8217;s Gun</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov&#8217;s_gun</p>

<blockquote><p>Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it&#8217;s not going to be fired, it shouldn&#8217;t be hanging there.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anton Chekhov is considered to be among the greatest writers of short
stories in history. Guess I should start reading.</p>

<h2>Binding to an interface</h2>

<p>You can bind to a single interface, or ALL interfaces, lol!</p>

<p><code>0.0.0.0</code> means all interfaces. I guess that means that requests to
localhost, and potentially some other external facing interface, will
route requests to this socket. So what if someone has already bound
specifically to localhost:12345 and you try to bind to <code>0.0.0.0:12345</code>?</p>

<p>Answer: I don&#8217;t know&#8230; need to learn about what other interfaces are
available</p>

<p>REVISED ANSWER: I can use the IP provided by my router.</p>

<pre><code>ruby -run -e httpd . --port=4124 --bind-address=192.168.1.3
</code></pre>

<p>Then if I type <code>localhost:4124</code> in the browser, it don&#8217;t work, but if I
type <code>192.168.1.3:4124</code> in the browser, IT WORKS. :)</p>

<p>But to the original question, it turns out you can run ALL THREE of
these:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -run -e httpd . --port=4123 --bind-address=0.0.0.0
ruby -run -e httpd . --port=4123 --bind-address=192.168.1.3
ruby -run -e httpd . --port=4123 --bind-address=localhost
</code></pre>

<p>So the first and 3rd of these should be able to respond to</p>

<pre><code>curl localhost:4123 &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that the third (localhost) always wins. Makes sense. What about</p>

<pre><code>curl 192.168.1.3:4123 &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>And the more specific second one always wins. So I guess the OS will
look for a match of interface+port before falling back to 0.0.0.0.
Makes sense.</p>

<h2>listen queue size</h2>

<pre><code>socket.listen(10)
</code></pre>

<p>This means your socket will buffer up to 10 connections before
<code>ECONNREFUSED</code> is return to the shits on the other side.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re getting a lot of ECONNREFUSED, it probably means users are
already experiencing some some queue-based lag, and you should rethink
your architecture, spin up more server instances, etc. But you can also
just set to the max size via</p>

<pre><code>server.listen(Socket::SOMAXCONN)
</code></pre>

<h2>A connection is a socket</h2>

<p>When you accept() after binding, you&#8217;ll get a connection object, which
is just a Socket, but different from your server socket; it&#8217;s just a
file wrapper for that particular connection that you can write shit to.</p>

<h2>quadruple of remote/ip/port must be unique</h2>

<p>You can&#8217;t have more than one connection where</p>

<pre><code>local addr, local port, remote addr, and remote port
</code></pre>

<p>are not totally unique. Hmmm, so where is this prevented? TODO</p>

<h2>Close socket file descriptors</h2>

<p>Why, doesn&#8217;t this happen automatically on exit/GC?</p>

<ol>
<li>GC might not clean up for you fast enough;</li>
<li>Might hit file descriptor limit</li>
</ol>


<p>Wat wat wat wat in the boot.</p>

<p>You can close the read side, or close the write side, or both. This make
use of <code>shutdown</code>, and shutdown will close a side of a connection even
if you&#8217;re dup&#8217;d file descriptors (explicitly or via fork). <code>close</code>
wouldn&#8217;t actually close unless there were no other file descriptors
holding on to that socket.</p>

<h2>Keybase</h2>

<p>Uses social media accounts to prove crypto identity.</p>

<h2>Clients don&#8217;t need to bind</h2>

<p>to a port when connecting to a server. For obvious reasons. Namely that
a server needs to have a known/consistent port in order for clients to
reach it, but a client can just send from any ol po,]rt.</p>

<h2>Long ass timeouts</h2>

<pre><code>require 'socket'
socket = Socket.new(:INET, :STREAM)
remote_addr = Socket.pack_sockaddr_in(666, 'machty.com')
socket.connect(remote_addr)
</code></pre>

<p>This won&#8217;t fail any time soon. (Note if i&#8217;d given a BS DNS then it would: SocketError
exception from getaddrinfo). Only after a long ass time do you get a
ETIMEDOUT.</p>

<p>getaddrinfo seems cool. I guess it&#8217;s the C function that does a DNS
lookup? Nevermind, man <code>getaddrinfo</code> makes me cry.</p>

<p>So when does ECONNREFUSED happen vs just a long ass timeout? I guess it
means you&#8217;ve hit a server but a) no app is bound to the requested port
or b) the queue is full, and probably c) some other reason. No that&#8217;s
not valid; google.com:70 hangs for a while rather than ECONNREFUSED.</p>

<p>Maybe localhost knows what&#8217;s connected or not? I have NO IDEA.</p>

<h2><code>TIME_WAIT</code></h2>

<p>If you close a socket with pending outbound data, it won&#8217;t discard that
data but rather finish sending (and wait for ack) before totally closing
the socket. This is the <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state. Unless you&#8217;ve enabled
<code>REUSEADDR</code>, you&#8217;ll get an <code>EADDRINUSE</code> if you try to bind to a socket
that&#8217;s still in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state.</p>

<h2><code>EAGAIN</code></h2>

<p>Commonly seen in non-blocking IO operations when there&#8217;s no data
available to read. Reading nonblockingly from a socket that hasn&#8217;t had EOF set yet but
doesn&#8217;t have data at the moment would cause that.</p>

<p>Non blocking reads will find any data in Ruby buffers, followed by
kernel buffers. If there&#8217;s nothing in there, then blocking read is
necessary.</p>

<h2>Ruby IO.write</h2>

<p><code>IO.write_nonblock</code> behavior maps to sys call <code>write()</code>, in that it can
fail to write all the data you provided it. Ruby&#8217;s <code>IO.write</code> tries to
be helpful and might internally call <code>write()</code> many times.</p>

<p>A saturated <code>write()</code> followed immediately by <code>write()</code> will cause an
<code>EAGAIN</code> because you haven&#8217;t given the kernel/network enough time to
flush the data you gave it. This is when you&#8217;d use <code>IO.select</code> to let
you know when a socket is available for writing/reading again.</p>

<p>Wat wat wat. In the BOOT.</p>

<p><code>select</code> returns an array of descriptors that are ready to be written
to. I guess it blocks?</p>

<p>Writes are blocked by TCP congestion prevention algo requirements
(cwnd, rwnd, etc).</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also <code>accept_nonblock</code> which <code>EAGAIN</code>s if there are no pending
connection on dat queue.</p>

<p><code>connect_nonblock</code> is sp</p>

<h2>TPC Resets</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_reset_attack</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a usually-0 flag in a packet that can be set to 1 that tells the
receiver to stop using this TCP connection. Useful, for instance, when a
computer&#8217;s crashed, gets a packet it has no context for, so it tells the
sender to stop it, so that it might make a new connection and start from
there.</p>

<h2>Edge Device</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_device</p>

<p>Basically, all the stuff that separates the public network (internet)
from your private network.</p>

<ul>
<li>routers</li>
<li>routing switches</li>
</ul>


<h2>traceroute</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve already written about this before, but traceroute is useful for
tracing all the gateways your packet goes through to get to its
destination.</p>

<p>A gateway is any node that might forward packets along to some other
destination. Could be a router, switch, etc. Could also be a protocol
converter. Gateways could be software too.</p>

<p>Anyway, traceroute makes use of ICMP <code>TIME_EXCEEDED</code> response.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">What is ICMP?</a></p>

<p>One of the many protocols that can be communicated via packets. Packets
have an 8 bit protocol field. The protocol values are decided by the
IANA (just like common/reserved ports&#8230; MIND BLOWN).</p>

<p>The list is here: http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml</p>

<h2><code>host google.com</code></h2>

<p>I noticed that the DNS lookup results via <code>host google.com</code> differed
almost each time I ran it.</p>

<pre><code>google.com has address 74.125.226.72
google.com has address 74.125.226.65
google.com has address 74.125.226.68
google.com has address 74.125.226.67
google.com has address 74.125.226.64
google.com has address 74.125.226.70
google.com has address 74.125.226.78
google.com has address 74.125.226.69
google.com has address 74.125.226.73
google.com has address 74.125.226.71
google.com has address 74.125.226.66
...
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>google.com has address 74.125.226.2
google.com has address 74.125.226.5
google.com has address 74.125.226.8
google.com has address 74.125.226.9
google.com has address 74.125.226.6
google.com has address 74.125.226.4
google.com has address 74.125.226.3
google.com has address 74.125.226.14
google.com has address 74.125.226.7
google.com has address 74.125.226.0
google.com has address 74.125.226.1
...
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m asking the friendly folk at <code>##networking</code>. They turned me on to
<code>dig</code>. <code>dig</code> is the most raw and flexible DNS lookup tool. <code>host</code> is
apparently for chumps (i.e. it&#8217;s useful/quick/easy but not as much
functionality).</p>

<pre><code>dig google.com @ns1.google.com +short | sort | md5
</code></pre>

<p>This queries a specific name server&#8230;</p>

<p>OK i have a bunch of questions:</p>

<p>Why do DNS records contain
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name">Fully Qualified Domain Names</a>
as references to name servers? That seems to make no sense&#8230; you have
to turn something like <code>ns1.google.com</code> into an IP by querying&#8230; the
DNS system?</p>

<p>Answer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Circular_dependencies_and_glue_records</p>

<ul>
<li>GET www.example.com /

<ul>
<li>Look up record, find its NS records</li>
<li>NS ns1.example.com</li>
<li>Need to get IP of ns1.example.com (we need to issue another DNS
request)</li>
<li>&#8230; circular dependency: you have to look up a name server&#8217;s IP
using that name server. Need some way to break dependency</li>
<li><p>Dependency broken by <code>AUTHORITY SECTION</code>, e.g.</p>

<p>;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
google.com.             60      IN      SOA     ns1.google.com. dns-admin.google.com. 1566886 7200 1800 1209600 300</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This is called the &#8220;glue&#8221;. It&#8217;s either in Authority or Additional
section? (I should find this out.)</p>

<p>Related: http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/vanity-nameservers/</p>

<p>DNSimple allows &#8220;vanity&#8221; name servers, which lets you pretend like
you&#8217;re a bigass enough company to own/maintain your own name servers,
and anyone looking at your DNS records will see your fake name servers,
like ns1.machty.com, but these servers obviously don&#8217;t actually exist;
DNSimple provides this service by sending &#8220;glue&#8221; that maps your fake
name servers to the IP addresses of their actual name servers.</p>

<p>Top-level domains live under root (.).</p>

<p>http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO-5.html</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why sometimes you&#8217;ll see stuff ending in a period, like
<code>ns1.dnsimple.com.</code>.</p>

<pre><code>;; ANSWER SECTION:
dnssimple.com.          597     IN      A       184.168.221.96
</code></pre>

<p>The dot is important! You know how you can just put <code>www</code> is the record
value? You could also do a fully qualified shit e.g. <code>www.machty.com.</code>
(note the period at the end).</p>

<p>So my question is: when does the glue record get sent?</p>

<p>Gimme the NS records for www.machty.com</p>

<pre><code>$ dig machty.com NS
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
machty.com.             3481    IN      NS      ns1.dnsimple.com.
machty.com.             3481    IN      NS      ns1a.dnsimple.com.
machty.com.             3481    IN      NS      ns2.dnsimple.com.
machty.com.             3481    IN      NS      ns2a.dnsimple.com.
machty.com.             3481    IN      NS      ns3.dnsimple.com.
machty.com.             3481    IN      NS      ns3a.dnsimple.com.
machty.com.             3481    IN      NS      ns4.dnsimple.com.
machty.com.             3481    IN      NS      ns4a.dnsimple.com.
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, so internally it&#8217;d need to look up ns1.dnsimple.com, so something
like:</p>

<pre><code>$ dig @ns1.dnsimple.com. www.machty.com
</code></pre>

<h2>Turntable.fm</h2>

<p>Me: &#8220;there should be an app where multiple people have a playlist, but
there&#8217;s a single player that alternates between different people&#8217;s
playlists.&#8221;</p>

<p>Person next to me: &#8220;yes, that&#8217;s turntable.fm&#8221;</p>

<p>Should probably check that out.</p>

<h2>non-blocking connect</h2>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8277970/what-are-possible-reason-for-socket-error-einprogress-in-solaris</p>

<p>There are two error codes for &#8220;shit is underway&#8221; when doing a
non-blocking connect/accept:</p>

<pre><code> [EALREADY]         The socket is non-blocking and a previous connection attempt
                    has not yet been completed.

 [EINPROGRESS]      The socket is non-blocking and the connection cannot be com-
                    pleted immediately.  It is possible to select(2) for comple-
                    tion by selecting the socket for writing.
</code></pre>

<p>Nice docs yo. The difference is that <code>EINPROGRESS</code> is the error that
gets returned if the operation has started but hasn&#8217;t finished (as
opposed to not yet being able to start because it can&#8217;t allocate the
resources it needs, file handlers, sockets, etc.). Most likely, the 3
way handshake packets have been sent, but SYN-ACK hasn&#8217;t been sent.</p>

<h2>Inversion of Control / DI</h2>

<p>Matthew Beale and I were discussing whether the proposed
<code>Ember.service()</code> violated the inversion of control that dependency
injection is meant to provide, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>export default Controller.extend({
  foo: Ember.service() // request that 'service:foo' be injected
});
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that the consumer is requesting a specific thing to be injected
into it seems like it might be an IOC violation, but to me, all that&#8217;s
happening is that you&#8217;re specifying a provider, and it&#8217;s still up to the
outside world to decide what it&#8217;ll specifically inject into you. Also,
regardless of whether it&#8217;s explicit or not, if you use whatever is
injected into you, you are implicitly specifying a duck-typed provider
interface by the consumer; in other words, if we do things the classic
way and use <code>app.inject('controller:article', 'articleLookup', 'service:article-lookup')</code>,
this may seem like we&#8217;re moving all &#8220;control&#8221; to the injector, but
still, the article controller is going access <code>articleLookup</code>&#8217;s
properties and methods in a very specific way, which is the most
powerful / crucial way that you could specify a dependency (by
describing / using the duck type interface).</p>

<p>So, tl;dr, your consumer is always going to be specifying its
dependency, whether explicitly (<code>Ember.service()</code>) or implicitly (by
whatever methods/properties it uses from <code>this.injectedThing</code>), and it&#8217;s
therefore not a violation for a consumer to specify a Provider of the
dependency, so long as it&#8217;s still possible for the injector to disregard
the specifically-requested provider and substitute another one (e.g. a
stub) in its place.</p>

<p>This is what Angular&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/angular/di.js">di.js</a> does
and I think it&#8217;s correct. I want it.</p>

<h2>Password-less SSH</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve done this a bunch of times before but always forget, now I&#8217;m
writing about it:</p>

<p>The remote server you&#8217;re SSHing into needs to have your public key if
you want to be able to skip providing a password every time you ssh in.
I wanted to use a different public rsa key, so I made a new one:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen
</code></pre>

<p>The optional passphrase you&#8217;re asked to supply is NOT the same password
you would have otherwise needed to use to log into SSH (which we&#8217;re
trying to avoid). Rather, it&#8217;s an additional security measure that&#8217;s
required every time you want to use your private RSA key to try and
decrypt data. I guess: if private RSA keys are a kind of password, the
passphrase is a password for your password. It means that someone who
steals your private key also needs to know your passphrase in order to
use it.</p>

<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s say I save the newly generated key pair to
<code>~/.ssh/shortcut_rsa</code> and <code>~/.ssh/shortcut_rsa.pub</code>, now I want to make
it possible to just type <code>ssh shortcut</code> and have it never ask me for a
password again. This means I need a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>ssh shortcut</code> should translate into the IP I&#8217;m connecting to
(because I&#8217;d rather not type the IP every time and <code>shortcut</code> is not
a domain name that&#8217;d do the translating for me)</li>
<li><code>ssh shortcut</code> should supply the user name that the remote machine
expects (so that I don&#8217;t have to do <code>ssh remote_user_name@shortcut</code>).</li>
<li><code>ssh shortcut</code> should use the key pair I just generated w
<code>ssh-keygen</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>To do all of these things, I need to append the following to
<code>~/.ssh/config</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Host shortcut
  HostName 162.123.123.123
  User remote_user_name
  IdentityFile "/Users/machty/.ssh/shortcut_rsa"
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty self explanatory and does the job. Note that you&#8217;ll be prompted
for the passphrase you provided for your RSA private key, but that&#8217;ll be
cached for a little while, and if you want, you can just save it to your
Apple keychain if you feel safe doing that.</p>

<p>The SSH config file also allows for wildcards, so you could literally do</p>

<pre><code>Host *
  HostName 162.123.123.123
  User remote_user_name
  IdentityFile "/Users/machty/.ssh/shortcut_rsa"
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>

<p>and then this would cause <code>ssh somerandombullshit</code> to connect to the
same remote machine. Obviously that use case is a little nuts, but it&#8217;s
useful if you wanna say &#8220;every remote machine I connect to should use
this same RSA key pair&#8221;.</p>

<h2>say+say+say = choir</h2>

<p>I devised the most badass script.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env sh

# use/uncomment this instead to weed out the annoying singing voices
#voices=`say -v ? | grep en_US | grep -v Cellos | grep -v Good | grep -v Hysterical | grep -v Bad | grep -v Pipe | grep -v Bells | cut -f1 -d ' '`
voices=`say -v ? | grep en_US | cut -f1 -d ' '`
num=`echo $voices | wc -w`
echo $voices | xargs -n 1 -P $num say $* -v
</code></pre>

<h2>How many segments are sent per SSH character?</h2>

<p>http://blog.hyfather.com/blog/2013/04/18/ssh-uses-four-tcp-segments-for-each-character/</p>

<p>Answer: 4</p>

<ol>
<li>You: Hey SSH server, user pressed &#8216;b&#8217;</li>
<li>SSH: cool, got it (ack)</li>
<li>SSH: hey btw, this is what <code>bash</code> (or whatever shell) ended up doing
with that character you type (description of screen update)</li>
<li>You: cool, got it (ack)</li>
</ol>


<p>What&#8217;s the difference between a segment and a packet?</p>

<ul>
<li>Segment: TCP header + application data</li>
<li>Packet: wraps segment w IP header information; a packet is a routable
piece of data</li>
</ul>


<p>This seems like the best answer: http://superuser.com/a/505134</p>

<p>A TCP segment is not enough information to know where to route data
within a network; you need IP headers for that, and where do those shits
live? In packets.</p>

<p>Take a packet and rip off its IP head: voila, a packet. Take a packet
and rip off its TCP (or UDP) head: voila, application data.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget &#8220;frames&#8221;: frames wrap packets. If you wanna send your shit
over an ethernet, you need to wrap in a frame, whether wired or
wireless. Frames have MAC addresses. MAC addresses are generally
hard-wired into some hardware and are never expected to collide, lest
undefined behavior.</p>

<p>Now my question is: does TCP ever have access to IP headers? I guess it
must get forwarded along in some way&#8230; then again I dunno.</p>

<h2>RFC3439: Some Internet Architectural Guidelines and Philosophy</h2>

<p>http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3439</p>

<p>Clearly I need to read this.</p>

<h2>Nagle&#8217;s Algo</h2>

<p>When sending data:</p>

<ol>
<li>If there&#8217;s enough data in local packet buffer to comprise a whole TCP
packet, send that shit.</li>
<li>If no pending data in buffers and no pending acks, send immediately.</li>
<li>If there&#8217;s a pending ack, and not enough data to fill a packet, put
data in local buffer.</li>
</ol>


<p>This prevents protocols like telnet from saturating with
one-packet-per-char traffic. For telnet, if you type a bunch of chars in
a row, you could expect that the first char would send immediately and
the following ones would buffer and then send once the first char&#8217;s ack
came back.</p>

<p>All Ruby servers disable this since Ruby does its own internal buffering
in the socket lib. You disable by sending with NODELAY.</p>

<h2>URG flag</h2>

<p>Apparently you can break the FIFO-ness of TCP with Urgent data.</p>

<p><code>Socket#send</code> is the same as <code>write</code> except that you can pass flags to
<code>send</code>, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>socket.send 'urgent data', Socket::MSG_OOB
</code></pre>

<p>OOB stands for out of band. Note that the receiver must use the same
flag w <code>recv</code> to read the OOB data or else it won&#8217;t notice it.</p>

<p>OOB is rarely used because:</p>

<ul>
<li>only one byte of urgent data can be sent</li>
<li>there are issues w <code>select</code> wherein consumed urgent data continues to
be reported as unread, requires additional state tracking to get
right, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>You could also use OOBINLINE flag to stick in an urgent byte amidst
normal queued data, and <code>read</code> will stop once it hits an urgent thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m guessing OOB is only a TCP thing since in UDP there&#8217;s no concept of
connection and &#8220;in order&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Datagram</h2>

<p>Data + telegram. From RFC 1594:</p>

<blockquote><p>“A self-contained, independent entity of data carrying sufficient information to be routed from the source to the destination computer without reliance on earlier exchanges between this source and destination computer and the transporting network.”</p>

<p>The term datagram is often considered synonymous to packet but there are some nuances. The term datagram is generally reserved for packets of an unreliable service, which cannot notify the sender if delivery fails, while the term packet applies to any packet, reliable or not. Datagrams are the IP packets that provide a quick and unreliable service like UDP, and all IP packets are datagrams;[4] however, at the TCP layer what is termed a TCP segment is the sometimes necessary IP fragmentation of a datagram,[5] but those are referred to as &#8220;packets&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, datagrams imply unreliability of delivery, whereas packet could
refer to reliable or unreliable packets. I guess a TCP segment is a
packet. But you can&#8217;t call it a datagram, since the protocol makes it
its business to be a shit.</p>

		<h2>Why can&#8217;t React render() return multiple elements?</h2>

<p>you can&#8217;t do</p>

<pre><code>return &lt;div/&gt;&lt;div/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Pete Hunt tells me it&#8217;s because of how <code>ref</code>s work; it&#8217;s a common
pattern to do <code>this.refs.x.getDOMNode()</code>, but if the component returns
multiple DOM nodes, which one do you return?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an admitted shortcoming but not a major major push to fix any time
soon.</p>

<h2>Ruby Fixnum vs Bignum</h2>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p353 :004 &gt; (100).class
 =&gt; Fixnum
2.0.0-p353 :005 &gt; (100234234234234234234).class
 =&gt; Bignum
</code></pre>

<h2>Postgres indexing</h2>

<p>I need to optimize. Most of the queries in my app are very specific
&#8220;SELECT WHERE bleh = wat, lol = yeah, foo = bar&#8221;. By default Rails
creates a btree index, which handles many common indexing use cases, but
there&#8217;s also a &#8220;hash&#8221; index, which Postgres only considers for usage for
<code>bleh = bleh</code> queries (you can&#8217;t use it for ordering, sorting,
whatever), so it seemed ideal for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hash indexes can only handle simple equality comparisons. The query planner will consider using a hash index whenever an indexed column is involved in a comparison using the = operator.</p></blockquote>

<p>But then I&#8217;d like it to match multiple columns, not just a single one,
so I&#8217;d like to consider a multi-column index, but then:</p>

<blockquote><p>Currently, only the B-tree, GiST and GIN index types support multicolumn indexes. Up to 32 columns can be specified. (This limit can be altered when building PostgreSQL; see the file pg_config_manual.h.)</p></blockquote>

<p>So I guess Hash is out of the question. So the final thing I need to
figure out is: does it make sense for me to use a multi-column index if
I have three columns that need to be <code>=</code> matched?</p>

<p>Partial indexes: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/indexes-partial.html</p>

<p>Useful for when you&#8217;d like to exclude common values from consideration
in an index (because indexes lose value the more duplicates there are in
a database).</p>

<h2>V8 optimizes based on AST size</h2>

<p>&#8230;and comments are part of the AST:</p>

<p>https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli-kitchen-sink-helpers/commit/092a680f1ff8fe2d54419dd57fa9ba8a81f6f297</p>

<h2>General Theory of Reactivity</h2>

<p>https://github.com/kriskowal/gtor</p>

<p>Reactivity: reacting to external stimuli and propagating events.</p>

<ul>
<li>(functional) reactive programming</li>
<li>bindings</li>
<li><p>operational transform</p></li>
<li><p>Spatial Singular is a value, e.g. 5</p></li>
<li>Spatial Plural is an enumberable/iterable of values</li>
<li>Temporal Singular is an eventual value, e.g. a Promise</li>
<li>Temporal Plural is eventual values, e.g. Observable of values</li>
</ul>


<p>But this glazes over many particulars, and things like Rx boil too much
into a single Observable type that can perform any role.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<ul>
<li>Singular</li>
<li>Spatial</li>
<li>Accessible</li>
<li>Modifiable</li>
<li>Composed of a getter and a setter</li>
<li>Data flows from setter to getter</li>
</ul>


<p>Every reactive primitive features getter/setter, producer/consumer, or
writer/reader. See http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Keynote-Duality</p>

<p>Arrays are the above, but plural. Generators are the
producing/writing/setting side, iterators are the read/get/consume.</p>

<p>Promises are singular and temporal. Promises are getters, and
corresponding setter is a resolver. Together, they&#8217;re a kind of
deferred.</p>

<p>Streams are a getter/setter pair of temporal plurals. Producer is a
writer and consumer is a reader. Reader is an async iterator and writer
is an async generator.</p>

<p>Remember that a value encapsulates a getter and setter&#8230; values are:
Deferred (promise + resolver, singular, temporal), Stream (reader +
writer, plural, temporal), Array (iterator + generator, spatial,
plural), and value (getter + setter, spatial, singular).</p>

<p>Promises (singular + temporal) model dependency. The API/experience of
multiple resolvers is the same regardless of who wins the race, and same
w consumers.</p>

<p>Because consumers cannot interfere with another consumer, aborting
promises is not possible; promise is only the result, not the work
leading to that result.</p>

<p>A task, similar to promise, but is unicast.</p>

<p>Unicast: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast - sending messages to a
  single destination</p>

<p>Broadcast: multiple possible destinations (or none)</p>

<p>Because tasks are unicast, consumers can&#8217;t clobber each other (because
there&#8217;s only one), hence they are cancellable. Can be explicitly forked
to create a task that depends on the same result</p>

<p>DTD&#8217;s are arguably easier to grok, but the XSD has more features, but at

<h2>Breaking the chain in React</h2>

<h2>CVV can mean lower rates</h2>

<p>http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/21168/how-does-amazon-bill-me-without-the-cvc-cvv-cvv2</p>

<p>There are fraud-prevention benefits to using CVV, and as such, payment
handlers will often give you a discount if the CVV is present.</p>

<h2>X-Forwarded-For</h2>

<p>Some servers fall prey to IP spoofing via setting the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>
header. If your server isn&#8217;t careful, then given a
<code>curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4" http://www.machty.com</code>, your
server&#8217;s logs and maybe even IP-dependent application logic (e.g.
language detection) might use 1.2.3.4.</p>

<p>In Rails you can add your known proxy/load-balancing IPs to
<code>TRUSTED_PROXIES</code>. Then the <code>RemoteIp</code> rack middleware will filter out
all of those and pick the most recently set IP, which handles the case
where you might have multiple <code>X-Fowarded-By</code> headers. So the rule is:
use the rightmost, untrusted IP and treat that as the remote ip. Why?
Because when your first proxy is hit, it&#8217;ll see IP X.X.X.X and move that
to the list of <code>X-Forwarded-By</code> headers. Note that the previous
<code>X-Forwarded-By</code> headers, present or no, are untrustable and totally
spoofable.</p>

<p>http://blog.gingerlime.com/2012/rails-ip-spoofing-vulnerabilities-and-protection</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s IP spoofing via HTTP header. How else can you IP spoof?</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing</p>

<p>You just rewrite the source IP in the TCP/UDP packet header, which also
means when the application responds, it&#8217;ll send it back to the forged
IP.</p>

<p>There are valid use cases for this as well, such as testing load
balancing software/hardware.</p>

<h2>Types of NAT</h2>

<p>http://think-like-a-computer.com/2011/09/16/types-of-nat/</p>

<h3>Full cone NAT (Static NAT) (port forwarding)</h3>

<p>Manual mapping of public IP and port to LAN IP and port.</p>

<p>e.g. all incoming traffic to port 12345, forward to 192.168.0.10:9999.</p>

<p>Blocks (drops connection):</p>

<ul>
<li>Ports that haven&#8217;t been forwarded</li>
</ul>


<h3>Restricted cone NAT (dynamic)</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t allow incoming data from an IP unless I&#8217;ve sent packets to it
already. Note that depending on the strictness, if I initiate a
connection to WAN IP 1.2.3.4:1234, I could potentially get data from
1.2.3.4:5678, but in stricter schemes, the port must also match.</p>

<p>But regardless of this strictness, the one requirement is that they send
data to exactly my public IP and port that I sent data out of.</p>

<h3>Symmetric NAT</h3>

<p>http://think-like-a-computer.com/2011/09/19/symmetric-nat/</p>

<p>Sym NAT is like port-restricted cone NAT, but randomly generates
different public source ports when sending to different destinations.</p>

<p>Sym NATs are the only ones that cause problems with other devices behind
NATs.</p>

<h2>Vim registers</h2>

<p>So if I have</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="WAT"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and I want to replace the href with a yanked &#8220;LOL&#8221;, then I can <code>di"</code> in
WAT to delete it, then <code>"0P</code> to use the last-yank register 0. Registers
1,2,3,4,5&#8230; get populated with cuts. Unnamed register gets replaced by
any yanking/cutting command. Weird terminology.</p>

<h2>Ember-cli + divshot</h2>

<p>Holy shit this was awesome.</p>

<p>Divshot.com is a static deployment heroku, basically, and ember-cli has
an addon for letting you deploy there.</p>

<pre><code>npm install --save-dev ember-cli-divshot &amp;&amp; ember generate divshot
</code></pre>

<h2>brew install fuck</h2>

<p>naw, but this is a cool script for killing them all:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# coding: utf-8

abort "Usage: fuck you &lt;name&gt;" unless ARGV[0] == "you" &amp;&amp; ARGV.size == 2

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqxyz".each_char.to_a
b = "ɐqɔpǝɟƃɥıɾʞʃɯuodbɹsʇnʌʍxʎz".each_char.to_a
ws = Hash[a.zip(b)]
ws.default = -&gt;(f){f}

puts "\n  (╯°□°）╯︵ #{ARGV[1].reverse.each_char.map{|f|ws[f]}.join}\n\n"

system("killall -9 #{ARGV[1]}")
exit $?.exitstatus
</code></pre>

<p>Questions:</p>

<li>singleton vs multiples?</li>
<li>actions that depend on others?</li>
<li>link-to?

<ul>
<li>idea: a LinkView asks the router or url service for an Action
using the route params, query params, etc.</li>
<li>LinkView&#8217;s active CP is <code>action.pending</code> || present day isActive</li>
<li>action will internally delegate to a shared transitionTo action
that everyone in the world can see; everyone can know where it&#8217;s
going, etc etc etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>We need to separate fake link font decoration style from the underlying
action.</p>

<p>Link&#8217;s display components:</p>

<pre><code>routeDescriptor: function() {
  // when resolvedParams change, we need to recalculate
  // our route object... this should refire only when
  // params change, not when the URL changes
  this.urlService.getRouteObject('articles', 1)


  this.urlService.createRouteDescriptor({
    routeName: alias('_linkView.params.firstObject'),
    contexts: alias('_linkView.contexts'),

createRouteDescriptor: function(_attrs) {
  var attrs = {
    router: this.router, // or maybe just `this`?
  };
  Ember.merge(attrs, _attrs);
  return RouteDescriptor.createWithMixins(attrs);
}

RouteDescriptor = Ember.Object.extend({
  // required
  router: null,
  routeName: null,
  contexts: null,
  queryParams: null,

  allParams: computed('routeName', 'contexts', 'queryParams', function() {

<p>RouteDescriptors are objects</p>

<ul>
<li>inactive: !routeObject.active</li>
<li>active:   routeObject.active</li>
<li>visited</li>
</ul>


<p>Weird thing: ember link-to&#8217;s concept of &#8220;active&#8221; doesn&#8217;t match with
<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag&#8217;s concept of active; link-to &#8216;active&#8217; means you&#8217;re currently
in the route specified by that link; <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag&#8217;s active means you&#8217;re
currently clicking this link.</p>

<p>I think I know how to refactor link-to and LinkView and all that</p>

<p>Goals</p>

<ul>
<li>make linking/routing/active calc logic shareable</li>
<li>make it possible to click a link to make it active before a slow
transition has completed.</li>
<li>support calculating activeness for bootstrap wrapper <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s and
anything else in general too.</li>
</ul>


<h2>RFCs</h2>

<p>Rust tempered it&#8217;s freewheeling feature additions by requiring RFCs.</p>

<p>https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/active/0001-rfc-process.md
https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/active/0039-lifetime-elision.md</p>

<p>Sounds like we&#8217;ll be doing this for Ember.</p>

<h2>Elide</h2>

<blockquote><p>omit (a sound or syllable) when speaking: (as adj. elided) : the indication of elided consonants or vowels.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Variadic</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function</p>

<p>A function that is variadic has an indefinite number of arguments.
<code>.bind</code></p>

<blockquote><p>8:50 PM <spion> bind is variadic and I think it also has to do some stuff with constructors
8:51 PM <spion> (additional arguments can be used for partial application)
8:52 PM <spion> the constructor stuff: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Bound_functions_used_as_constructors
8:53 PM <spion> (creates significant additional overhead)
8:53 PM <spion> so a simple non-variadic closure implementation of bind has a lot less work to do :P</p></blockquote>

<p>Rationale: http://spoike.ghost.io/deconstructing-reactjss-flux/</p>

<h2>Promixo dedicated</h2>

<p>https://addons.heroku.com/proximo#dedicated</p>

<h2>CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing</p>

<p>Classful allocation of IP addresses (pre 1993) defined class A, B, C
network groups split along the 8 bit chunks. Problem is the smallest
allocation (256 addresses, assuming you were allocated something like
123.456.789.XXX) was often too small for companies, whereas the next
step up from that (123.456.XXX.XXX) was generally too huge (65536) for
companies/entities to efficiently take advantage of. SOLUTION: CIDR
blocks and subnet masks.</p>

<blockquote><p>This led to inefficiencies in address use as well as routing because the large number of allocated small (class-C) networks with individual route announcements, being geographically dispersed with little opportunity for route aggregation, created heavy demand on routing equipment.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, class C allocations are 123.456.789.XXX allocations,
each containing 256 addresses, with no requirement that they be
geographically grouped, such that routers had to maintain large tables
for very similar looking addresses rather than being able to rely on
some grouping rules to minimize the routing information they had to know
about. But now subnet masking is a thing and blah blah blah I&#8217;m done
learning this shit.</p>

<p>192.168.2.0/24 means that the network is identified by the first 24 bits</p>

<blockquote><p>192.168.100.0/24 represents the given IPv4 address and its associated routing prefix 192.168.100.0, or equivalently, its subnet mask 255.255.255.0 (i.e. 24 &#8220;1&#8221; bits).</p>

<p>the IPv4 block 192.168.100.0/22 represents the 1024 IPv4 addresses from 192.168.100.0 to 192.168.103.255.</p></blockquote>

<h2>TokenEx client-side encryption</h2>

<p>Original misconception:</p>

<ul>
<li>You post directly to TokenEx via AJAX, and they give you an encrypted
value that you can pass to your server and exchange for a token</li>
</ul>


<p>Correction:</p>

<ul>
<li>You only use JSEncrypt to encrypt the PAN via a public key.</li>
</ul>


<p>Wait, I don&#8217;t understand, with tokenizing, if you have a token saved in
the database, then your server, if compromised, could still send data
through to TokenEx, which would proxy it through to whomever.</p>

<h2>Form Factor</h2>

<p>https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Mobile_Payment_Security_Guidelines_Merchants_v1.pdf</p>

<blockquote><p>The PCI Security Standards Council charter provides a forum for collaboration across the payment space
to develop security standards and guidance for the protection of payment card data wherever it may be
stored, processed, or transmitted—regardless of the <em>form factor</em> or channel used for payment.</p></blockquote>

<p>the physical size and shape of a piece of computer hardware.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_form_factor</p>

<p>or phone.</p>

<p>what a stupid fucking phrase/word/definition.</p>

		<h2>NPM is killing me</h2>

<p>Apparently this fixed everything.</p>

<pre><code>npm cache clear &amp;&amp; npm install
</code></pre>

<p>https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-cache.html</p>

<p>npm caches everything in <code>npm config get cache</code>, which for me is:</p>

<pre><code>~/.npm
</code></pre>

<p>Folder structure is something like</p>

<pre><code>~/.npm/PACKAGE_NAME/VERSION/
</code></pre>

<p>which contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>.cache.json

<ul>
<li>lots of overlap w the project&#8217;s package.json, with additional
cache-specific things like</li>
<li>etag, shasum</li>
<li>deployment-specific data about the package</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>package.tgz

<ul>
<li>the original tarball downloaded for this packaage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>package/

<ul>
<li>the unzipped tarball</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words</p>

<blockquote><p>Additionally, whenever a registry request is made, a .cache.json file is placed at the corresponding URI, to store the ETag and the requested data. This is stored in {cache}/{hostname}/{path}/.cache.json.</p></blockquote>

<h2><code>sed</code> to select lines</h2>

<pre><code>$ git branch
  cp-qp
* master
  new-doctitle
  setup-controller-qp
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to switch to the fourth one without typing
<code>setup-controller-qp</code>. Here&#8217;s how you could do it by using the line
number</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch | sed -n '4p' | xargs git checkout
Switched to branch 'setup-controller-qp'
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is just a dumb exercise since it&#8217;s waaay more typing.
This is me practicing.</p>

<p>You can also display multiple lines using a syntax similiar to cut&#8217;s
<code>-f1,2</code> syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch | sed -n '3,4p' 
  new-doctitle
  setup-controller-qp

each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number
of bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last
modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the
pathname.  In addition, for each directory whose contents are dis-
played, the total number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the
directory is displayed on a line by itself, immediately before the
information for the files in the directory.  If the file or directory
has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l
option is followed by a '@' character.  Otherwise, if the file or
directory has extended security information (such as an access control
list), the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a
'+' character.

<h2>Interrupted System Call</h2>

<p>http://infohost.nmt.edu/~eweiss/222_book/222_book/0201433079/ch10lev1sec5.html</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting some shit about foreman and interrupted system calls. So
what is it.</p>

<h2>&#8220;data at the edge&#8221;</h2>

<p>Keeping secure data at the edge of your infrastructure, e.g. using
tokens instead of storing CC&#8217;s in your db.</p>

<h2>PAN (primary account number)</h2>

<p>Bank card number.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_account_number</p>

<h2>CP (card present)</h2>

<p>e.g AuthorizeNetCP</p>

<p>Cheaper rates if you can prove card present (via CVV).</p>

<h2>TokenEx</h2>

<p>ProcessTransaction</p>

<p>ProcessTransactionWithPAN</p>

<ul>
<li>pass in all the CC data; no</li>
</ul>


<h2>Levenshtein Distance</h2>

<p>The minimum number of single-element operations (add, remove,
substitute) between two sequences. Often used for spell-checking
suggestions.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using it to do an array diffing for React-ish stuff.</p>

<pre><code>Array 1: B C D E F
Array 2: A B C D E
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly the answer to how to get from 1 to 2 is</p>

<pre><code>shift A
delete E
</code></pre>

<p>But how to programmatically detect that?</p>

<h2>Ruby String Substring Shorthand</h2>

<p>https://speakerdeck.com/headius/jruby-the-hard-parts</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t know this&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>s = "alex is quite maudlin"
s['quite'] = 'very'
s =&gt; "alex is very maudlin"
</code></pre>

<p>and if the substring isn&#8217;t in there, then</p>

<pre><code>IndexError: string not matched
</code></pre>

<p>http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/String.html#method-i-5B-5D-3D</p>

<h2>JRuby the Hard Parts</h2>

<p>Goal: understand this talk https://speakerdeck.com/headius/jruby-the-hard-parts</p>

<h2>Learn about encodings</h2>

<p>I had to resort to this shit:</p>

<pre><code>line = line.force_encoding("iso-8859-1")
</code></pre>

<p>for a bigass file because I was running into</p>

<pre><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15399530/ruby-match-invalid-byte-sequence-in-utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently you can open files as a certain encoding. Seems good.</p>

<h2>Auto-inline CSS with Roadie</h2>

<p>https://github.com/Mange/roadie</p>

<p>Useful for supporting a vast array of shitty email clients that require
inline CSS. This wouldn&#8217;t be a problem if web components.</p>

		<h2>User and Kernel</h2>

<p>http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-user-and-kernel-mode/</p>

<p>Non-idle tasks.</p>

<p>The CPU graph is tasty. Red means kernel.</p>

<p>CPU hardware knows all about kernels n shit. It isn&#8217;t just a software
divide. CPU instructions and certain memory locations can only be
accessed by the kernel, enforced by hardware. User mode makes it so that
only the app crashes, not the entire system.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(computer_security)</p>

<p>Interesrserseting.</p>

<p>x86 CPU hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li>0 is kernel</li>
<li>3 is user</li>
</ul>


<p>1 and 2 are device drivers but they&#8217;re not often used. On Windows,
device drivers can be user or kernel mode, mostly to the user, but video
cards are often kernel level since they so perfy. In Vista+, the Windows
Driver Display Model is such that only kernel mode is used for executing
the GPU commands, but the translation from API to GPU now takes place in
userland.</p>

<p>Exceptions fire in kernel land I guess? Sometimes?</p>

<h2>Old Foreman Orphans Sidekiq</h2>

<p>After lots of starts/stops of foreman, I noticed lots of sidekiq
instances with ppid 1. They was orphans. I killed em.</p>

<h2>fspawn</h2>

<p>Refers to the fork+exec approach to spawning a process.</p>

<h2>Daemons</h2>

<p>https://github.com/ghazel/daemons</p>

<p>Library of fun little trinkets.</p>

<ul>
<li>given some-server.rb, let&#8217;s you write a some-server-control.rb</li>
<li>inline the server inside such a daemon (you can still run it
without forking via <code>run</code> command)</li>
<li>manage multiple daemons</li>
<li>Ability to take existing server and daemonize it; you do lose control
over the daemon unless you&#8217;re a <code>ps</code>/<code>kill</code> JOURNEYMAN.

<ul>
<li>this takes advantage of the <code>fork</code> <code>getsid</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>https://github.com/ghazel/daemons/blob/master/lib/daemons.rb#L45-L53</p>

<pre><code># 1.  Forks a child (and exits the parent process, if needed)
# 2.  Becomes a session leader (which detaches the program from
#     the controlling terminal).
# 3.  Forks another child process and exits first child. This prevents
#     the potential of acquiring a controlling terminal.
# 4.  Changes the current working directory to "/".
# 5.  Clears the file creation mask (sets +umask+ to 0000).
# 6.  Closes file descriptors (reopens +STDOUT+ and +STDERR+ to point to a logfile if
#     possible).
</code></pre>

<p>Controlling terminal:</p>

<p>http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Controlling-Terminal.html</p>

<blockquote><p>An individual process disconnects from its controlling terminal when it calls setsid to become the leader of a new session.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah I get it:</p>

<ul>
<li>first fork is to orphan the child, but it&#8217;s still connected to a
controlling terminal/session.</li>
</ul>


<p>https://github.com/ghazel/daemons/blob/master/lib/daemons/daemonize.rb#L201</p>

<p>They actually loop through all known IO files to close file
descriptors using ObjectSpace:</p>

<p>http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/ObjectSpace.html</p>

<p>https://github.com/ghazel/daemons/blob/master/lib/daemons/daemonize.rb#L221</p>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty rad. I guess the GC uses it too.</p>

<h2>.pid file</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s a file in a well known location that contains only the pid of
some running process, usually a daemon. Useful because daemons are often
hard to detect, kinda look like forgotten orphan processes, and there
might be multiple similar ones. But pid files let you look up the pid of
the running process so that you can send it signals.</p>

<h2><code>$0</code> or <code>$PROGRAM_NAME</code></h2>

<p>If you run this script</p>

<pre><code>fork {
  $PROGRAM_NAME = "WAT"
  sleep
}
</code></pre>

<p>then <code>ps | grep WOOT</code> yields</p>

<pre><code>62724 ttys022    0:00.00 WOOT
</code></pre>

<p>Woot wat wat wotasoasdas lol.</p>

<h2><code>pidof</code></h2>

<pre><code>brew install pidof

$ pidof bash
754 1246 1748 2308 2498 5380 20397 23552 26224 26973 48454 79258 81847 5226 5346 5443 5851 10659 25008 26375 27009 52684 88768 88882 18853 19116 19246 20275 20476 21364 43211 52269 52390 52637 54869 54974 58037 58950 59080
