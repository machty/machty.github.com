		<h2>nginx book</h2>

<p>This is nice: http://aosabook.org/en/nginx.html</p>

<p>Some random notes:</p>

<p>For CPU-bound loads, number of nginx workers should equal the number of
cores (&#8220;TCP/IP, doing SSL, or compression&#8221;). For IO-bound stuff
(&#8220;serving different sets of content from storage, or heavy proxying&#8221; &#8211;
presumably teh &#8220;different sets&#8221; is important because if it were
the same stuff, it&#8217;d probably be cached which I guess means the IO would
be negligible? unsure) &#8211; you might want 1.5-2 times the number of
cores.</p>

<h2>SSL/TLS random questions:</h2>

<p>I have so many misconceptions? For anyone who reads this, this is stream
of thought as I try to answer my own questions before looking shit up.</p>

<p>How come domains are signed and not IPs?</p>

<p>Reasoned guess: first off, everyone can encrypt data. It&#8217;s just that the
key thing that TLS brings in is certification of a sending. It&#8217;s not
enough to say &#8220;yo here&#8217;s my public key&#8221;, you still have to answer the
question &#8220;uh ok yes but who are you?&#8221;. Certificate authority to the
rescue.</p>

<p>So what if CA&#8217;s certified IPs, rather than domain names (maybe they do,
I don&#8217;t actually know at this point)? Some ideas come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>DNS can map to multiple IPs, and a single IP might load balance to
many different servers, all of which should be able to (de)/encrypt
incoming traffic.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&#8217;s actually probably the only reason. I was originally thinking
that since IPs can change, you might certify server A and then the next
day the IP changes to server B, and that that would mean the CA is
giving a stamp of approval to the wrong server, but then, duh, it&#8217;s key
pairs that are being validated, and server B wouldn&#8217;t have these keys
and wouldn&#8217;t know how to do the handshake. I think this is close to
correct, it&#8217;s just I&#8217;m forgetting everything that happens internally
within the handshake.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security</p>

<h2>Symmetric Key</h2>

<p>A single key encrypts plaintext and decrypts the ciphertext generated
from the encryption.</p>

<p>Example: AES.</p>

<h2>Cipher suite</h2>

<p>https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4</p>

<p>A triple of</p>

<ul>
<li>authentication</li>
<li>encryption</li>
<li>and message authentication c</li>
</ul>


<h2>SSL / TLS</h2>

<p>Lots of people use them interchaangeably, but SSL was originally created
at Netscape and used to be implemented at the application layer, living
on top of TCP. When it was IETF standardized, it was renamed TLS and
moved out of the application layer.</p>

<p>TLS provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>encryption

<ul>
<li>obfuscate data transmitted from one computer to another</li>
<li>example: plaintext means zero encryption and easily breakable
ciphertext means shitty encryption</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>authentication</li>
<li>verify that you&#8217;re talking to who you think you&#8217;re talking to</li>
<li>example: the CA validates the certificate that a server sends you</li>
<li>integrity

<ul>
<li>detect message forgery or tampering</li>
<li>example:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Beware the intermediaries</h2>

<p>Intermediaries are caching servers, gateways, web accelerators, content
filters, blah blah blah, all the stuff that&#8217;s come out to aid and extend
HTTP. They&#8217;re often transparent to the end user, but they come with the
limitation that if you start wanting to deviate from HTTP on port 80 in some
application specific way, you&#8217;re boned. And it&#8217;s kinda rare to find
other ports that are open: 80 and 443 (HTTPS) are usually open but
everything else is often closed. These intermediaries might improperly
try to apply their logic to the non HTTP, etc, there&#8217;s no easy way to
detect when or when not to apply.</p>

<p>Solution: HTTPS tunnel all the things. All data is obfuscated from
intermediaries and intermediaries have no way of known whether the
encrypted data is HTTP or some custom proprietary crazy thing.</p>

<h2>Self-signed certificates</h2>

<p>http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html</p>

<p>Things learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;If the private key is no longer encrypted, it is critical that this file only be readable by the root user!&#8221;</li>
<li>You can remove the DES from the private key so that you don&#8217;t have to
type in the password all the god damn time when your server starts.
(Verified this with a node app)</li>
</ul>


<p>Turns out you could also just run the following:</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -new 
</code></pre>

<p>So why is DES required at all? I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s possible to generate a
CSR without it, right?</p>

<h2>ALPN: Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation</h2>

<p>Note to dummy: there&#8217;s no TLS 3 way handshake. You&#8217;re thinking of TCP
ACK SYN SYNACK that has to happen before app data is exchanged.</p>

<p>ALPN takes place during the</p>

<h2>SNI: Server Name Indication</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3546.txt">rfc, page 8</a></p>

<p>If you have a server that you want to host multiple sites with their own
respective TLS certificates,</p>

<h2>self-signed-certificate</h2>

<p>Useful for testing SSL before you go ahead and buy a certificate for 3rd
party validation.</p>

<h2>AES vs RSA</h2>

<p>AES is symmetric, and generally speaking symmetric encryption/decryption
is a lot faster than assymetric, hence AES is used for the
encryption/decryption of data.</p>

<h2>Sprite gotchas</h2>

<p>I used to think sprites were bitchin; save HTTP requests, combine all
your images into one. Obviously, these are lame application-level
optimizations/hacks to cover the ass of the transport layer&#8217;s (HTTP&#8217;s)
shortcomings (addressed in SPDY / HTTP 2.0).</p>

<p>Downsides of sprites:</p>

<ul>
<li>all the application-layer crap you have to do to handle it</li>
<li>change a single pixel of a single image and you&#8217;ve busted a massive
cached of all the other images in the sprite</li>
<li>memory intensive; you might not be using each image but you have to
load all of it in memory, might be too much for mobile clients</li>
</ul>


<h2>Octet</h2>

<p>It means byte. Saw it all over the place in the
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2/?include_text=1">HTTP 2 spec draft</a></p>

<h2>nginx</h2>

<p>After <code>brew install nginx</code></p>

<pre><code>Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

To have launchd start nginx at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load nginx now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    nginx

WARNING: launchctl will fail when run under tmux.
</code></pre>

<p>What is docroot?</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a file&#8230; not a directory?</li>
<li>But you can delete it and replace with a directory and put an
index.html in there and it works</li>
<li>So I guess there&#8217;s some default configuration of nginx that just hosts
static files from this doc root directory</li>
</ul>


<p>What do them commands does?</p>

<pre><code>ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
</code></pre>

<p>What are launchd and launchctl?</p>

<p><code>launchd</code> is a daemon (conventions dictate that daemons end in a <code>d</code>).
<code>launchctl</code> is what you use to control that daemon. So if you want to
schedule something to start</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the <code>mxcl</code> in <code>homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist</code>?</p>

<p>It refers to <code>mxcl</code>, maintainer of Homebrew. Just normal reverse domain
name notation. So does that mean any homebrew-installed domains get
prefixed like that? I&#8217;m guessing <code>mxcl</code> also made the Redis recipe.
Or maybe every homebrew daemon gets prefixed like that? Not sure, who
cares.</p>

<pre><code> In the launchd lexicon, a "daemon" is, by definition, a system-wide service of
 which there is one instance for all clients. An "agent" is a service that runs
 on a per-user basis. Daemons should not attempt to display UI or interact
 directly with a user's login session. Any and all work that involves interacting
 with a user should be done through agents.
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083/_index.html">TN2083 - Daemons and Agents</a></p>

<p>Wow, &#8220;Daemonomicon&#8221; is an awesome word: &#8220;formal definition of the types
of bg programs you can write&#8221;.</p>

<ul>
<li>bootstrap server: launchd</li>
<li>root session: first and last session. Boot-time processes and daemons
live here. User-independent. e.g. <code>mDNSResponder</code></li>
<li>login session: proceses launched by or for a user live in login
session. Login sessions are associated w authenticated users. Each
user</li>
</ul>


<p>If I</p>

<h2>Origins of TTY</h2>

<p>http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/</p>

<ul>
<li>stock tickers, then ASCII teletype within a network called Telex.</li>
<li>Telex was a network that used level of current to respresent different
characters, vs different voltages used by analog telephone shit</li>
<li>Telex existed before integration w computers</li>
<li>When command lines became the norm, teletypes were used as input and
output since they were readily available on the market</li>
<li>Lots of different models, needed to standardize in some way; UNIX
philosophy dictated letting kernel handle low level word length, baud
rate, flow control, etc., later things like color output, cursor
movement, etc, was left to application (not kernel)</li>
<li>Line editing is managed by OS-provided line discipline. Default is
cooked/canonical mode. raw mode disables things like editing,
backspace, and generally disables any IO processing within the line
discipline.</li>
</ul>


<p>Skipping ahead, you can force your terminal into stty raw mode via</p>

<pre><code>stty raw #enable
stty -raw #disable
</code></pre>

<p>Now I know how to write a Ruby impl of Press Any Key</p>

<pre><code>print "Press any key... "

begin
  system("stty raw -echo")
  c = STDIN.getc
ensure
  # re-enable
  system("stty -raw echo")
end

puts "Thanks!"
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it&#8217;ll consume CTRL-C as well rather than signalling an
interrupt (hence CTRL-C prints &#8220;Thanks!&#8221; rather than terminating
immediately).</p>

<p>This is also how any text editor functions.</p>

<p>This must be what&#8217;s happening when I kill some script when it doesn&#8217;t
expect it and then my terminals fucked. Typing in <code>stty -raw</code> even
though I can&#8217;t see it probably would fix it&#8230; need to try.</p>

<p>Back to the thing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kernel provides many line disciplines, only one attached to serial
device at a time. Default is <code>n_tty</code>. I guess that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re
configuring when we futz w <code>stty</code></li>
<li>Other disciplines are for things like packet switched data</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/devices/lxr/http/source/linux/drivers/char/n_tty.c">tty C source code</a></li>
<li>UART (Universal Async Receiver and Transmitter): converts teletype
signal into bytes that the OS can process. OS has a UART driver.</li>
<li>TTY driver: allows user to kill/suspend an infinite looped program,
bg processes can process til they try to write to terminal (at which
point they suspend), and user input to fg process only.
(implemented in <code>tty_io.c</code>)</li>
<li>TTY Device: triplet of UART driver, line discipline, and TTY driver.</li>
<li>TTY devices live in <code>/dev</code> w file mode <code>c</code> for &#8220;Character special
file&#8221;. To manipulate one, you need ownership of the device file
(e.g. via <code>login</code>).</li>
<li>TTYs are just objects. Not alive. Other things plug into it. Those
other things have execution contexts.</li>
<li>pty = pseudoterminal, as opposed to TTY.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>ps -o stat</code> prints out <code>Ss</code> <code>Ss+</code>, etc&#8230; here&#8217;s what the capital
letters mean:</p>

<pre><code>R   Running or runnable (on run queue)
D   Uninterruptible sleep (waiting for some event)
S   Interruptible sleep (waiting for some event or signal)
T   Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced by a debugger.
Z   Zombie process, terminated but not yet reaped by its parent.
</code></pre>

<p>Most things are in <code>S</code>. An example of <code>R</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e 'loop {}'
</code></pre>

<p><code>s</code> means session group leader. <code>+</code> means process is part of foreground
process group.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ctrl Z suspends a process, puts it in <code>T</code> state.</li>
</ul>


<p>Jobs, e.g. <code>fg</code> and <code>bg</code> are just process groups. Consider</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e 'loop {}'  | grep a | grep a | grep a
</code></pre>

<p>This causes as CPU-intensive loop and will be in R state.</p>

<pre><code>USER     PID  PPID  PGID   SESS JOBC STAT   TT       TIME COMMAND
machty 45754 45014 45754      0    4 R+   s045    7:03.43 ruby -e loop {}
machty 45755 45014 45754      0    4 S+   s045    0:00.00 grep a
machty 45756 45014 45754      0    4 S+   s045    0:00.00 grep a
machty 45757 45014 45754      0    4 S+   s045    0:00.00 grep a
</code></pre>

<p>and when I suspend:</p>

<pre><code>USER     PID  PPID  PGID   SESS JOBC STAT   TT       TIME COMMAND
machty 45754 45014 45754      0    4 T    s045    7:29.05 ruby -e loop {}
machty 45755 45014 45754      0    4 T    s045    0:00.00 grep a
machty 45756 45014 45754      0    4 T    s045    0:00.00 grep a
machty 45757 45014 45754      0    4 T    s045    0:00.00 grep a
</code></pre>

<p>Everything below it suspends.</p>

<p><code>jobs</code> are tied to session leaders, and terminals are session leaders.
If I go to another tmux pane and type <code>jobs</code>, the suspended job <em>won&#8217;t</em>
show up; I have to be in the same terminal that started it. TODO: can I
change session IDs?</p>

<p>If I <code>bg 1</code>, the following happens:</p>

<pre><code>USER     PID  PPID  PGID   SESS JOBC STAT   TT       TIME COMMAND
machty 45754 45014 45754      0    4 R    s045    7:39.63 ruby -e loop {}
machty 45755 45014 45754      0    4 S    s045    0:00.00 grep a
machty 45756 45014 45754      0    4 S    s045    0:00.00 grep a
machty 45757 45014 45754      0    4 S    s045    0:00.00 grep a
</code></pre>

<p>Note how it&#8217;s back to running, but note the missing foreground <code>+</code>. <code>fg 1</code>
would bring it back.</p>

<p>Note that we could turn one of those greps into <code>R</code> if it was actively
processing data, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>USER     PID  PPID  PGID   SESS JOBC STAT   TT       TIME COMMAND
machty 46054 45014 46054      0    4 R+   s045    0:37.84 ruby -e loop { puts "a" }
machty 46055 45014 46054      0    4 R+   s045    0:45.56 grep a
machty 46056 45014 46054      0    4 R+   s045    0:27.01 grep b
machty 46057 45014 46054      0    4 S+   s045    0:00.00 grep a
</code></pre>

<p>(Actually, the first 3 R&#8217;s might be S&#8217;s if you re-run this command;
there&#8217;s a race condition as to whether the CPU is actually running code
or whether it&#8217;s blocked on an IO syscall waiting for piped data to come
in, but the last grep is always S+ because it never gets output from the
<code>grep b</code>).</p>

<p>A Job is a Processs Group.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re just starting/stopping/piping processes, all those child
processes with have a parent process ID of <code>bash</code>&#8217;s pid.</p>

<p>What constitutes a job/process group? Piped commands for one.
Let&#8217;s see about Process Subsitution. Answer: process substitution
doesn&#8217;t consider it as a pipe. It considers it as a shit of epic
fartitude. In other words, process substitution ends up being miserably
old and mortal and definitely going to die. In other words, process
substitution is not in the same process group. It&#8217;s its own process
group. If you do <code>echo &lt;(some long living thing)</code>, the long living thing
will survive as a sibling process, in its own process GROUP WHO CARES.</p>

<p>You can only read from  / write to TTY if you&#8217;re foreground. If you&#8217;re
not <code>fg</code> and you try and write to TTY, kernel will suspend your ass.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ioctl</code> is the UNIX swiss army knife; manipulates special files like
terminals.</li>
<li><code>ioctl</code> requests must be initated from processes, so the kernel can&#8217;t
asyncly communicate w an application unless the app asked for it.</li>
<li>Signals are how kernel communicates asyncly w a process. Messy and
error prone they are.</li>
</ul>


<p>Question: nohup detaches into its own session id to prevent closing on
SIGHUP&#8230; why does it have to do that? Why can&#8217;t it just ignore that
signal? Let&#8217;s see.</p>

<pre><code>Signal.trap(:HUP) do
  puts "I WILL NOT"
end
sleep
</code></pre>

<p>If I ssh localhost and run that in background (with <code>&amp;</code>) and then
logout, it stays running, PPID changes to 1 (root). So how is that
different than nohup? TODO: find out. Something with setsid, etc.</p>

<p>SIGINT&#8217;s originate from the terminal&#8230; is it correct to say they
originate from TTY? I think it is based on the <code>n_tty.c</code> code.
Also, in raw mode it doesn&#8217;t even fire. COOL.</p>

<ul>
<li>SIGPIPE isn&#8217;t just an error but also a way to know whoever was
listening to you has stopped listening to you, e.g. <code>yes | head</code>.</li>
<li>SIGSTOP is to SIGTSTP as SIGKILL is to SIGQUIT.</li>
<li>SIGCONT can be sent to a ^Z-suspended process. It behaves as if you
started the process with <code>&amp;</code>. It&#8217;s running, but it&#8217;s bg. In other
words, if you have a suspended process 12345, <code>bg 1</code> or
<code>kill -CONT 12345</code> would do the same thing; it&#8217;d start running in the
background, spitting out output</li>
<li>You can break shit with
<code>ruby -e 'Signal.trap(:TTIN) { puts "wat" }; sleep 1; gets' &amp;</code>
(recursive SIGTTIN). You try and write to TTY in the background and
then keep ignoring the signal that it&#8217;s failing. I don&#8217;t know what
causes the deadlock though, but <em>something</em> screwing up sounds right.</li>
<li>If you press ^Z, that sends a message to the foreground process group.
The line discipline sends <code>SIGTSTP</code> to the foreground process group.
This will suspend the whole process group, whatever the main</li>
</ul>


<p>Question: if you use pipes combined with <code>&amp;</code>, what gets put into the
background? All tasks? Answer (I think): <code>&amp;</code> ultimately results in a
process group getting put into the background, and a process group
contains any pipes, child processes, etc, so it <em>must</em> apply to all of
the different processes as a whole, and there&#8217;s no way to say that only
one of the pipe segments runs in the background.</p>

<p>Fun fact: you can reimplement the default ^Z behavior as follows:</p>

<pre><code>has_ignored = false
Signal.trap(:TSTP) do
  if has_ignored
    Process.kill(:STOP, Process.getpgrp)
  else
    has_ignored = true
    puts "ignoring"
  end
end

sleep
</code></pre>

<p>TL;DR the default SIGTSTP ^Z handler fires a STOP. You can catch TSTP
and immediately do the same for the same effect.</p>

<p>Vim&#8217;s source code (and probably everyone&#8217;s) does some variant of</p>

<pre><code>settmode(TMODE_COOK);
kill(0, SIGTSTP);       /* send ourselves a STOP signal */
</code></pre>

<p>So, you return TTY mode to cook mode.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you run something like <code>echo "wat" | less &amp;</code>, you&#8217;ll immediately
see <code>[2]+  Stopped   echo "wat" | less</code> because <code>less</code> is always going
to try and write to TTY in a raw manner&#8230;?</li>
<li>If you suspend, say, vim, vim will catch the SIGTSTP, move the cursor
to the last line of the screen w control signals (it&#8217;s still attached
to TTY) and then fires a SIGSTOP.</li>
<li>Once stopped, a SIGCHLD is sent to the session leader with the pid of
the suspended process. When all processes in fg have been suspended
(T&#8217;d), the current TTY config is stashed for later restoration
(<code>stty -g</code> is one way of doing this).</li>
</ul>


<p>So why doesn&#8217;t ^Z suspend bash?</p>

<p>Ahh, so here&#8217;s how you get TTOU to fire (and cause a process to suspend)</p>

<pre><code>ruby -r "io/console" -e "IO.console.raw { puts 'wat' }" &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if we hadn&#8217;t used <code>.raw</code> to put TTY in raw mode, it would have
just printed &#8220;wat&#8221; into the same terminal even though the process is
running in the background, but if you grab full control of the TTY with
<code>raw</code>, it&#8217;ll cause a TTOU.</p>

<p>You can go in and configure another TTY to update its rows/cols. I can
fuck w the vim in another tmux pane, tell it its skinnier/wider than it
is, but once i resized a tmux pane then BOOM it fires its own tty
commands, and tty fires a SIGWINCH, and then that causes vim to query
the tty for the current width and repaint.</p>

<p>Ah: realization: the ultimate decider in whether TTOU fires is whether
topstop</p>

<h2><code>read</code></h2>

<pre><code>read words &lt; &lt;(echo "wat")
echo $words
</code></pre>

<h2>resetting the keyboard when things go crazy</h2>

<p><code>reset</code>, or typing Escape and c.</p>

<pre><code>stty raw
reset
</code></pre>

<p>and we&#8217;re back. It resets your TTY driver, I guess.</p>

<h2><code>yes</code></h2>

<p>Repeatedly enter <code>y</code> for saying yes to everything. Like the dropper bird
from the simpsons when homer gets fat. You can also do <code>yes no</code> to say
other things.</p>

<h2>Ack</h2>

<p>is written in Perl.</p>

<h2>100 Continue status</h2>

<p>An HTTP 1.1 mechanism.</p>

<p>http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html</p>

<p>In some cases, a server knows just by looking at request headers that it
won&#8217;t process the request, making it potentially wasteful for the client to send a
giant doomed-to-fail payload. In these cases, the client can decide not
the send the full payload unless the server has told it &#8220;based on your
headers, you should Continue sending this full payload because I don&#8217;t
see any reason why it should fail, just by looking at the headers.&#8221;</p>

<p>To opt into this, the client must provide the following header:</p>

<pre><code>Expect: 100-continue
</code></pre>

<p>The server will see this, decide if the request will succeed, and if so,
it send back 100 Continue and keeps reading from the input stream.
Client then sends the whole payload.</p>

<p>Proxies can reject if it knows the next-hop server is HTTP 1.0 or less
with a 417 Expectation Failed.</p>

		<h2>FTP</h2>

<p>Plaintext, unless you&#8217;re using SFTP or some variant.</p>

<p>FTP uses multiple connections: 1 control connection for sending
commands and tracking current directory, etc, and a connection for
actually streaming the file data.</p>

<p>How the second connection (data) is established depends on active vs
passive mode: in active mode, the server will try to connect back to the
client at PORT+1, and in most modern cases, this will fail due to NATs
and firewalls, hence passive mode (via PASV) command is meant to get
around this. In passive mode, the client requests an IP and port from
the server (via the control connection), and then the client makes the
second connection to whatever the server returns. This works as clients can
generally connect to servers without NAT/firewall issues.</p>

<p>Note that active connections are rare. The man page for <code>ftp</code> is
telling:</p>

<pre><code>-A          Force active mode ftp.  By default, ftp will try to use passive mode
            ftp and fall back to active mode if passive is not supported by the
            server.  This option causes ftp to always use an active connection.
            It is only useful for connecting to very old servers that do not
            implement passive mode properly.
</code></pre>

<h2>Application-level gateway</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-level_gateway</p>

<p>TODO: learn more.</p>

<h2>Process per connection</h2>

<p>One way of handling a new connection is to fork and let the forked
process handle that connection. Makes sense for the parent instance to
use Ruby&#8217;s <code>Process.detach</code>, which doesn&#8217;t have a native kernel
equivalent but is just a Ruby convenience that spins up a thread that
calls <code>wait()</code> on the forked process to prevent it from becoming a
zombie if the parent process exits before the forked one.</p>

<p>Remember that forking isn&#8217;t available on Windows or JRuby.</p>

<p><code>shotgun</code> is a Ruby server that forks per connection. Why? Isn&#8217;t this
wasteful (relative to pre-forking solutions like Unicorn)? Yes, but it
has specific purpose: assuming it&#8217;s not painfully expensive to spin up
your server (like Rails), and that you don&#8217;t have a mechanism for
reloading after code changes (like Rails), <code>shotgun</code> will fork per
connection and entirely reload / spin up the rack server, less reloading
the latest version of any Ruby code, thus not requiring you to manually
restart your server.</p>

<h2>Thread per connection</h2>

<p>Typical state-sharing caveats apply when working with threads, hence
it&#8217;s useful to thing about the simple unit of concurrency that will keep
your threads isolate and minimize their access to shared data. That unit
would be a connection; each thread should get its own connection object.
Create a connection object, immediately create a new thread, and let
that connection object fall out of scope in the creator thread so that
only the newly spawned thread has access to it. Simple enough.</p>

<h2>How to verify your code is on multiple cores</h2>

<p>You have to dig in a little bit to verify that Ruby code you&#8217;re writing
is actually being processed on multiple CPU cores. There are many
variables:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does your system even have more than one core? (try <code>system_profiler | grep 'Total Number of Cores'</code> to find out, probably some other ways too)</li>
<li>Does your Ruby have a GIL? (MRI does, Rubinius and JRuby don&#8217;t)</li>
<li>Some third thing to pad my arbitrary list of bullshit.</li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, one easy way is to run the following code:</p>

<pre><code>NUM_CORES = 2

threads = []
NUM_CORES.times do |t|
  threads &lt;&lt; Thread.new do
    log_every = 1000000
    i = 0
    loop do
      i += 1
      if i == log_every
        i = 0
        putc t.to_s
      end
    end
  end
end

threads.each(&amp;:join)
</code></pre>

<p>Running this on MRI Ruby results in 100% CPU usage. Running in JRuby
yields 200%, which means two cores are operating at 100%. Pretty rad,
yes?</p>

<p>CPU usage reported by activity monitor or <code>top -o cpu</code>.</p>

<h2>Preforking</h2>

<p>e.g Unicorn</p>

<p>What&#8217;s nice is that the kernel will handle load-balancing for us: when
there are no incoming requests, you have N forked instances blocked on
<code>accept</code>, and the kernel will choose which instance gets the next
incoming request. If all forked instances are busy, the kernel will just
queue up the request internally. If the queue gets full, you&#8217;ll get an
ECONNREFUSED. Easy peazy.</p>

<p>Unicorn (and probably Rainbows) does some extra tracking on child
processes to make sure it&#8217;s not getting stuck on long requests, etc.</p>

<p>Main disadvantage is memory usage. By the time you fork, if the parent
process is 100 mb, then 4 forks and you&#8217;re at 500 mb&#8230; unless 1) your
OS has COW and 2) you don&#8217;t write to it all that much.</p>

<h2>Reactor</h2>

<p>e.g. Node.js, Twisted, EventMachine</p>

<p>High levels of concurrency (not necessarily parallelism) achievable,
relative to threading/forking models, which hit their RAM limit much
faster (Reactor patterns mean that everything is just heap allocations
on the same thread).</p>

<p>Impacts on programming model:</p>

<ul>
<li>No processes/threads, so no shared memory, synchronization, etc, to
have to worry about</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t block the single Reactor thread (because nothing else will be able to
run). You wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about this in thread/processland.
This is why if you&#8217;re using EventMachine, your gems must be
event-machine aware, otherwise they&#8217;ll block (which would be fine in a
threading/forking environment).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Node cluster</h2>

<p>http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html</p>

<p>Based on the fact that you can use child process forking to split heavy
duty work into process that can each live on a different core, if that&#8217;s
what you&#8217;re about.</p>

<p>Note that there&#8217;s no C-like or Ruby-like fork in Node; you can&#8217;t just
call fork and then have both the parent and newly forked child process
continue execution from that <code>fork()</code> invocation&#8230;</p>

		<h2>netcat (nc)</h2>

<p>Utility to spinning up arbitrary tcp servers for testing, sending
packets, etc.</p>

<pre><code>Socket.new(Socket::AF_INET, Socket::SOCK_STREAM)
or symbols:
Socket.new(:INET6, :STREAM)
</code></pre>

<p>INET = internet, specifically IPv4, <code>SOCK_STREAM</code> means a TCP stream
will be set up, as opposed to <code>DGRAM</code>, which would set up UDP.</p>

<p>Set up bullshit listener:</p>

<pre><code>nc -l localhost 4481
</code></pre>

<h2>Loopback</h2>

<p><code>localhost</code> is a loopback, which is a virtual interface where any data
sent to the loopback is immediately received. <code>127.0.0.1</code> is the IP.</p>

<p>Check dat <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
</code></pre>

<p>Funny how I never notice stuff like that until someone officially
defines it for me.</p>

<h2>&#8220;well-known&#8221; ports</h2>

<p>Hosted by IANA.org, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.</p>

<h2>Gerrymandering</h2>

<blockquote><p>manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favor one party or class.</p></blockquote>

<p>Knew what this was, forgot the word for it.</p>

<h2>AWS Spot Instances</h2>

<p>Running interruption-tolerant applications on EC2 unused capacity, where
you can bid on price per hour and maximum bid price.</p>

<h2>Chekhov&#8217;s Gun</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov&#8217;s_gun</p>

<blockquote><p>Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it&#8217;s not going to be fired, it shouldn&#8217;t be hanging there.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anton Chekhov is considered to be among the greatest writers of short
stories in history. Guess I should start reading.</p>

<h2>Binding to an interface</h2>

<p>You can bind to a single interface, or ALL interfaces, lol!</p>

<p><code>0.0.0.0</code> means all interfaces. I guess that means that requests to
localhost, and potentially some other external facing interface, will
route requests to this socket. So what if someone has already bound
specifically to localhost:12345 and you try to bind to <code>0.0.0.0:12345</code>?</p>

<p>Answer: I don&#8217;t know&#8230; need to learn about what other interfaces are
available</p>

<p>REVISED ANSWER: I can use the IP provided by my router.</p>

<pre><code>ruby -run -e httpd . --port=4124 --bind-address=192.168.1.3
</code></pre>

<p>Then if I type <code>localhost:4124</code> in the browser, it don&#8217;t work, but if I
type <code>192.168.1.3:4124</code> in the browser, IT WORKS. :)</p>

<p>But to the original question, it turns out you can run ALL THREE of
these:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -run -e httpd . --port=4123 --bind-address=0.0.0.0
ruby -run -e httpd . --port=4123 --bind-address=192.168.1.3
ruby -run -e httpd . --port=4123 --bind-address=localhost
</code></pre>

<p>So the first and 3rd of these should be able to respond to</p>

<pre><code>curl localhost:4123 &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that the third (localhost) always wins. Makes sense. What about</p>

<pre><code>curl 192.168.1.3:4123 &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>And the more specific second one always wins. So I guess the OS will
look for a match of interface+port before falling back to 0.0.0.0.
Makes sense.</p>

<h2>listen queue size</h2>

<pre><code>socket.listen(10)
</code></pre>

<p>This means your socket will buffer up to 10 connections before
<code>ECONNREFUSED</code> is return to the shits on the other side.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re getting a lot of ECONNREFUSED, it probably means users are
already experiencing some some queue-based lag, and you should rethink
your architecture, spin up more server instances, etc. But you can also
just set to the max size via</p>

<pre><code>server.listen(Socket::SOMAXCONN)
</code></pre>

<h2>A connection is a socket</h2>

<p>When you accept() after binding, you&#8217;ll get a connection object, which
is just a Socket, but different from your server socket; it&#8217;s just a
file wrapper for that particular connection that you can write shit to.</p>

<h2>quadruple of remote/ip/port must be unique</h2>

<p>You can&#8217;t have more than one connection where</p>

<pre><code>local addr, local port, remote addr, and remote port
</code></pre>

<p>are not totally unique. Hmmm, so where is this prevented? TODO</p>

<h2>Close socket file descriptors</h2>

<p>Why, doesn&#8217;t this happen automatically on exit/GC?</p>

<ol>
<li>GC might not clean up for you fast enough;</li>
<li>Might hit file descriptor limit</li>
</ol>


<p>Wat wat wat wat in the boot.</p>

<p>You can close the read side, or close the write side, or both. This make
use of <code>shutdown</code>, and shutdown will close a side of a connection even
if you&#8217;re dup&#8217;d file descriptors (explicitly or via fork). <code>close</code>
wouldn&#8217;t actually close unless there were no other file descriptors
holding on to that socket.</p>

<h2>Keybase</h2>

<p>Uses social media accounts to prove crypto identity.</p>

<h2>Clients don&#8217;t need to bind</h2>

<p>to a port when connecting to a server. For obvious reasons. Namely that
a server needs to have a known/consistent port in order for clients to
reach it, but a client can just send from any ol po,]rt.</p>

<h2>Long ass timeouts</h2>

<pre><code>require 'socket'
socket = Socket.new(:INET, :STREAM)
remote_addr = Socket.pack_sockaddr_in(666, 'machty.com')
socket.connect(remote_addr)
</code></pre>

<p>This won&#8217;t fail any time soon. (Note if i&#8217;d given a BS DNS then it would: SocketError
exception from getaddrinfo). Only after a long ass time do you get a
ETIMEDOUT.</p>

<p>getaddrinfo seems cool. I guess it&#8217;s the C function that does a DNS
lookup? Nevermind, man <code>getaddrinfo</code> makes me cry.</p>

<p>So when does ECONNREFUSED happen vs just a long ass timeout? I guess it
means you&#8217;ve hit a server but a) no app is bound to the requested port
or b) the queue is full, and probably c) some other reason. No that&#8217;s
not valid; google.com:70 hangs for a while rather than ECONNREFUSED.</p>

<p>Maybe localhost knows what&#8217;s connected or not? I have NO IDEA.</p>

<h2><code>TIME_WAIT</code></h2>

<p>If you close a socket with pending outbound data, it won&#8217;t discard that
data but rather finish sending (and wait for ack) before totally closing
the socket. This is the <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state. Unless you&#8217;ve enabled
<code>REUSEADDR</code>, you&#8217;ll get an <code>EADDRINUSE</code> if you try to bind to a socket
that&#8217;s still in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state.</p>

<h2><code>EAGAIN</code></h2>

<p>Commonly seen in non-blocking IO operations when there&#8217;s no data
available to read. Reading nonblockingly from a socket that hasn&#8217;t had EOF set yet but
doesn&#8217;t have data at the moment would cause that.</p>

<p>Non blocking reads will find any data in Ruby buffers, followed by
kernel buffers. If there&#8217;s nothing in there, then blocking read is
necessary.</p>

<h2>Ruby IO.write</h2>

<p><code>IO.write_nonblock</code> behavior maps to sys call <code>write()</code>, in that it can
fail to write all the data you provided it. Ruby&#8217;s <code>IO.write</code> tries to
be helpful and might internally call <code>write()</code> many times.</p>

<p>A saturated <code>write()</code> followed immediately by <code>write()</code> will cause an
<code>EAGAIN</code> because you haven&#8217;t given the kernel/network enough time to
flush the data you gave it. This is when you&#8217;d use <code>IO.select</code> to let
you know when a socket is available for writing/reading again.</p>

<p>Wat wat wat. In the BOOT.</p>

<p><code>select</code> returns an array of descriptors that are ready to be written
to. I guess it blocks?</p>

<p>Writes are blocked by TCP congestion prevention algo requirements
(cwnd, rwnd, etc).</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also <code>accept_nonblock</code> which <code>EAGAIN</code>s if there are no pending
connection on dat queue.</p>

<p><code>connect_nonblock</code> is sp</p>

<h2>TPC Resets</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_reset_attack</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a usually-0 flag in a packet that can be set to 1 that tells the
receiver to stop using this TCP connection. Useful, for instance, when a
computer&#8217;s crashed, gets a packet it has no context for, so it tells the
sender to stop it, so that it might make a new connection and start from
there.</p>

<h2>Edge Device</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_device</p>

<p>Basically, all the stuff that separates the public network (internet)
from your private network.</p>

<ul>
<li>routers</li>
<li>routing switches</li>
</ul>


<h2>traceroute</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve already written about this before, but traceroute is useful for
tracing all the gateways your packet goes through to get to its
destination.</p>

<p>A gateway is any node that might forward packets along to some other
destination. Could be a router, switch, etc. Could also be a protocol
converter. Gateways could be software too.</p>

<p>Anyway, traceroute makes use of ICMP <code>TIME_EXCEEDED</code> response.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">What is ICMP?</a></p>

<p>One of the many protocols that can be communicated via packets. Packets
have an 8 bit protocol field. The protocol values are decided by the
IANA (just like common/reserved ports&#8230; MIND BLOWN).</p>

<p>The list is here: http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml</p>

<h2><code>host google.com</code></h2>

<p>I noticed that the DNS lookup results via <code>host google.com</code> differed
almost each time I ran it.</p>

<pre><code>google.com has address 74.125.226.72
google.com has address 74.125.226.65
google.com has address 74.125.226.68
google.com has address 74.125.226.67
google.com has address 74.125.226.64
google.com has address 74.125.226.70
google.com has address 74.125.226.78
google.com has address 74.125.226.69
google.com has address 74.125.226.73
google.com has address 74.125.226.71
google.com has address 74.125.226.66
...
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>google.com has address 74.125.226.2
google.com has address 74.125.226.5
google.com has address 74.125.226.8
google.com has address 74.125.226.9
google.com has address 74.125.226.6
google.com has address 74.125.226.4
google.com has address 74.125.226.3
google.com has address 74.125.226.14
google.com has address 74.125.226.7
google.com has address 74.125.226.0
google.com has address 74.125.226.1
...
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m asking the friendly folk at <code>##networking</code>. They turned me on to
<code>dig</code>. <code>dig</code> is the most raw and flexible DNS lookup tool. <code>host</code> is
apparently for chumps (i.e. it&#8217;s useful/quick/easy but not as much
functionality).</p>

<pre><code>dig google.com @ns1.google.com +short | sort | md5
</code></pre>

<p>This queries a specific name server&#8230;</p>

<p>OK i have a bunch of questions:</p>

<p>Why do DNS records contain
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name">Fully Qualified Domain Names</a>
as references to name servers? That seems to make no sense&#8230; you have
to turn something like <code>ns1.google.com</code> into an IP by querying&#8230; the
DNS system?</p>

<p>Answer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Circular_dependencies_and_glue_records</p>

<ul>
<li>GET www.example.com /

<ul>
<li>Look up record, find its NS records</li>
<li>NS ns1.example.com</li>
<li>Need to get IP of ns1.example.com (we need to issue another DNS
request)</li>
<li>&#8230; circular dependency: you have to look up a name server&#8217;s IP
using that name server. Need some way to break dependency</li>
<li><p>Dependency broken by <code>AUTHORITY SECTION</code>, e.g.</p>

<p>;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
google.com.             60      IN      SOA     ns1.google.com. dns-admin.google.com. 1566886 7200 1800 1209600 300</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This is called the &#8220;glue&#8221;. It&#8217;s either in Authority or Additional
section? (I should find this out.)</p>

<p>Related: http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/vanity-nameservers/</p>

<p>DNSimple allows &#8220;vanity&#8221; name servers, which lets you pretend like
you&#8217;re a bigass enough company to own/maintain your own name servers,
and anyone looking at your DNS records will see your fake name servers,
like ns1.machty.com, but these servers obviously don&#8217;t actually exist;
DNSimple provides this service by sending &#8220;glue&#8221; that maps your fake
name servers to the IP addresses of their actual name servers.</p>

<p>Top-level domains live under root (.).</p>

<p>http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO-5.html</p>

<p>The dot is important! You know how you can just put <code>www</code> is the record

(note the period at the end).</p>

<p>So my question is: when does the glue record get sent?</p>

<p>Cool, so internally it&#8217;d need to look up ns1.dnsimple.com, so something

<h2>non-blocking connect</h2>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8277970/what-are-possible-reason-for-socket-error-einprogress-in-solaris</p>

<p>There are two error codes for &#8220;shit is underway&#8221; when doing a
non-blocking connect/accept:</p>

<pre><code> [EALREADY]         The socket is non-blocking and a previous connection attempt
                    has not yet been completed.

 [EINPROGRESS]      The socket is non-blocking and the connection cannot be com-
                    pleted immediately.  It is possible to select(2) for comple-
                    tion by selecting the socket for writing.
</code></pre>

<p>Nice docs yo. The difference is that <code>EINPROGRESS</code> is the error that
gets returned if the operation has started but hasn&#8217;t finished (as
opposed to not yet being able to start because it can&#8217;t allocate the
resources it needs, file handlers, sockets, etc.). Most likely, the 3
way handshake packets have been sent, but SYN-ACK hasn&#8217;t been sent.</p>

<h2>Inversion of Control / DI</h2>

<p>Matthew Beale and I were discussing whether the proposed
<code>Ember.service()</code> violated the inversion of control that dependency
injection is meant to provide, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>export default Controller.extend({
  foo: Ember.service() // request that 'service:foo' be injected
});
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that the consumer is requesting a specific thing to be injected
into it seems like it might be an IOC violation, but to me, all that&#8217;s
happening is that you&#8217;re specifying a provider, and it&#8217;s still up to the
outside world to decide what it&#8217;ll specifically inject into you. Also,
regardless of whether it&#8217;s explicit or not, if you use whatever is
injected into you, you are implicitly specifying a duck-typed provider
interface by the consumer; in other words, if we do things the classic
way and use <code>app.inject('controller:article', 'articleLookup', 'service:article-lookup')</code>,
this may seem like we&#8217;re moving all &#8220;control&#8221; to the injector, but
still, the article controller is going access <code>articleLookup</code>&#8217;s
properties and methods in a very specific way, which is the most
powerful / crucial way that you could specify a dependency (by
describing / using the duck type interface).</p>

<p>So, tl;dr, your consumer is always going to be specifying its
dependency, whether explicitly (<code>Ember.service()</code>) or implicitly (by
whatever methods/properties it uses from <code>this.injectedThing</code>), and it&#8217;s
therefore not a violation for a consumer to specify a Provider of the
dependency, so long as it&#8217;s still possible for the injector to disregard
the specifically-requested provider and substitute another one (e.g. a
stub) in its place.</p>

<p>This is what Angular&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/angular/di.js">di.js</a> does
and I think it&#8217;s correct. I want it.</p>

<h2>Password-less SSH</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve done this a bunch of times before but always forget, now I&#8217;m
writing about it:</p>

<p>The remote server you&#8217;re SSHing into needs to have your public key if
you want to be able to skip providing a password every time you ssh in.
I wanted to use a different public rsa key, so I made a new one:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen
</code></pre>

<p>The optional passphrase you&#8217;re asked to supply is NOT the same password
you would have otherwise needed to use to log into SSH (which we&#8217;re
trying to avoid). Rather, it&#8217;s an additional security measure that&#8217;s
required every time you want to use your private RSA key to try and
decrypt data. I guess: if private RSA keys are a kind of password, the
passphrase is a password for your password. It means that someone who
steals your private key also needs to know your passphrase in order to
use it.</p>

<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s say I save the newly generated key pair to
<code>~/.ssh/shortcut_rsa</code> and <code>~/.ssh/shortcut_rsa.pub</code>, now I want to make
it possible to just type <code>ssh shortcut</code> and have it never ask me for a
password again. This means I need a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>ssh shortcut</code> should translate into the IP I&#8217;m connecting to
(because I&#8217;d rather not type the IP every time and <code>shortcut</code> is not
a domain name that&#8217;d do the translating for me)</li>
<li><code>ssh shortcut</code> should supply the user name that the remote machine
expects (so that I don&#8217;t have to do <code>ssh remote_user_name@shortcut</code>).</li>
<li><code>ssh shortcut</code> should use the key pair I just generated w
<code>ssh-keygen</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>To do all of these things, I need to append the following to
<code>~/.ssh/config</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Host shortcut
  HostName 162.123.123.123
  User remote_user_name
  IdentityFile "/Users/machty/.ssh/shortcut_rsa"
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty self explanatory and does the job. Note that you&#8217;ll be prompted
for the passphrase you provided for your RSA private key, but that&#8217;ll be
cached for a little while, and if you want, you can just save it to your
Apple keychain if you feel safe doing that.</p>

<p>The SSH config file also allows for wildcards, so you could literally do</p>

<pre><code>Host *
  HostName 162.123.123.123
  User remote_user_name
  IdentityFile "/Users/machty/.ssh/shortcut_rsa"
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>

<p>and then this would cause <code>ssh somerandombullshit</code> to connect to the
same remote machine. Obviously that use case is a little nuts, but it&#8217;s
useful if you wanna say &#8220;every remote machine I connect to should use
this same RSA key pair&#8221;.</p>

<h2>say+say+say = choir</h2>

<p>I devised the most badass script.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env sh

# use/uncomment this instead to weed out the annoying singing voices
#voices=`say -v ? | grep en_US | grep -v Cellos | grep -v Good | grep -v Hysterical | grep -v Bad | grep -v Pipe | grep -v Bells | cut -f1 -d ' '`
voices=`say -v ? | grep en_US | cut -f1 -d ' '`
num=`echo $voices | wc -w`
echo $voices | xargs -n 1 -P $num say $* -v
</code></pre>

<h2>How many segments are sent per SSH character?</h2>

<p>http://blog.hyfather.com/blog/2013/04/18/ssh-uses-four-tcp-segments-for-each-character/</p>

<p>Answer: 4</p>

<ol>
<li>You: Hey SSH server, user pressed &#8216;b&#8217;</li>
<li>SSH: cool, got it (ack)</li>
<li>SSH: hey btw, this is what <code>bash</code> (or whatever shell) ended up doing
with that character you type (description of screen update)</li>
<li>You: cool, got it (ack)</li>
</ol>


<p>What&#8217;s the difference between a segment and a packet?</p>

<ul>
<li>Segment: TCP header + application data</li>
<li>Packet: wraps segment w IP header information; a packet is a routable
piece of data</li>
</ul>


<p>This seems like the best answer: http://superuser.com/a/505134</p>

<p>A TCP segment is not enough information to know where to route data
within a network; you need IP headers for that, and where do those shits
live? In packets.</p>

<p>Take a packet and rip off its IP head: voila, a packet. Take a packet
and rip off its TCP (or UDP) head: voila, application data.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget &#8220;frames&#8221;: frames wrap packets. If you wanna send your shit
over an ethernet, you need to wrap in a frame, whether wired or
wireless. Frames have MAC addresses. MAC addresses are generally
hard-wired into some hardware and are never expected to collide, lest
undefined behavior.</p>

<p>Now my question is: does TCP ever have access to IP headers? I guess it
must get forwarded along in some way&#8230; then again I dunno.</p>

<h2>RFC3439: Some Internet Architectural Guidelines and Philosophy</h2>

<p>http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3439</p>

<p>Clearly I need to read this.</p>

<h2>Nagle&#8217;s Algo</h2>

<p>When sending data:</p>

<ol>
<li>If there&#8217;s enough data in local packet buffer to comprise a whole TCP
packet, send that shit.</li>
<li>If no pending data in buffers and no pending acks, send immediately.</li>
<li>If there&#8217;s a pending ack, and not enough data to fill a packet, put
data in local buffer.</li>
</ol>


<p>This prevents protocols like telnet from saturating with
one-packet-per-char traffic. For telnet, if you type a bunch of chars in
a row, you could expect that the first char would send immediately and
the following ones would buffer and then send once the first char&#8217;s ack
came back.</p>

<p>All Ruby servers disable this since Ruby does its own internal buffering
in the socket lib. You disable by sending with NODELAY.</p>

<h2>URG flag</h2>

<p>Apparently you can break the FIFO-ness of TCP with Urgent data.</p>

<p><code>Socket#send</code> is the same as <code>write</code> except that you can pass flags to
<code>send</code>, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>socket.send 'urgent data', Socket::MSG_OOB
</code></pre>

<p>OOB stands for out of band. Note that the receiver must use the same
flag w <code>recv</code> to read the OOB data or else it won&#8217;t notice it.</p>

<p>OOB is rarely used because:</p>

<ul>
<li>only one byte of urgent data can be sent</li>
<li>there are issues w <code>select</code> wherein consumed urgent data continues to
be reported as unread, requires additional state tracking to get
right, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>You could also use OOBINLINE flag to stick in an urgent byte amidst
normal queued data, and <code>read</code> will stop once it hits an urgent thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m guessing OOB is only a TCP thing since in UDP there&#8217;s no concept of
connection and &#8220;in order&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Datagram</h2>

<p>Data + telegram. From RFC 1594:</p>

<blockquote><p>“A self-contained, independent entity of data carrying sufficient information to be routed from the source to the destination computer without reliance on earlier exchanges between this source and destination computer and the transporting network.”</p>

<p>The term datagram is often considered synonymous to packet but there are some nuances. The term datagram is generally reserved for packets of an unreliable service, which cannot notify the sender if delivery fails, while the term packet applies to any packet, reliable or not. Datagrams are the IP packets that provide a quick and unreliable service like UDP, and all IP packets are datagrams;[4] however, at the TCP layer what is termed a TCP segment is the sometimes necessary IP fragmentation of a datagram,[5] but those are referred to as &#8220;packets&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, datagrams imply unreliability of delivery, whereas packet could
refer to reliable or unreliable packets. I guess a TCP segment is a
packet. But you can&#8217;t call it a datagram, since the protocol makes it
its business to be a shit.</p>

		<h2>Why can&#8217;t React render() return multiple elements?</h2>

<p>you can&#8217;t do</p>

<pre><code>return &lt;div/&gt;&lt;div/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Pete Hunt tells me it&#8217;s because of how <code>ref</code>s work; it&#8217;s a common
pattern to do <code>this.refs.x.getDOMNode()</code>, but if the component returns
multiple DOM nodes, which one do you return?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an admitted shortcoming but not a major major push to fix any time
soon.</p>

<h2>Ruby Fixnum vs Bignum</h2>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p353 :004 &gt; (100).class
 =&gt; Fixnum
2.0.0-p353 :005 &gt; (100234234234234234234).class
 =&gt; Bignum
</code></pre>

<h2>Postgres indexing</h2>

<p>I need to optimize. Most of the queries in my app are very specific
&#8220;SELECT WHERE bleh = wat, lol = yeah, foo = bar&#8221;. By default Rails
creates a btree index, which handles many common indexing use cases, but
there&#8217;s also a &#8220;hash&#8221; index, which Postgres only considers for usage for
<code>bleh = bleh</code> queries (you can&#8217;t use it for ordering, sorting,
whatever), so it seemed ideal for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hash indexes can only handle simple equality comparisons. The query planner will consider using a hash index whenever an indexed column is involved in a comparison using the = operator.</p></blockquote>

<p>But then I&#8217;d like it to match multiple columns, not just a single one,
so I&#8217;d like to consider a multi-column index, but then:</p>

<blockquote><p>Currently, only the B-tree, GiST and GIN index types support multicolumn indexes. Up to 32 columns can be specified. (This limit can be altered when building PostgreSQL; see the file pg_config_manual.h.)</p></blockquote>

<p>So I guess Hash is out of the question. So the final thing I need to
figure out is: does it make sense for me to use a multi-column index if
I have three columns that need to be <code>=</code> matched?</p>

<p>Partial indexes: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/indexes-partial.html</p>

<p>Useful for when you&#8217;d like to exclude common values from consideration
in an index (because indexes lose value the more duplicates there are in
a database).</p>

<h2>V8 optimizes based on AST size</h2>

<p>&#8230;and comments are part of the AST:</p>

<h2>General Theory of Reactivity</h2>

<p>https://github.com/kriskowal/gtor</p>

<p>Reactivity: reacting to external stimuli and propagating events.</p>

<ul>
<li>(functional) reactive programming</li>
<li>bindings</li>
<li><p>operational transform</p></li>
<li><p>Spatial Singular is a value, e.g. 5</p></li>
<li>Spatial Plural is an enumberable/iterable of values</li>
<li>Temporal Singular is an eventual value, e.g. a Promise</li>
<li>Temporal Plural is eventual values, e.g. Observable of values</li>
</ul>


<p>But this glazes over many particulars, and things like Rx boil too much
into a single Observable type that can perform any role.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<ul>
<li>Singular</li>
<li>Spatial</li>
<li>Accessible</li>
<li>Modifiable</li>
<li>Composed of a getter and a setter</li>
<li>Data flows from setter to getter</li>
</ul>


<p>Every reactive primitive features getter/setter, producer/consumer, or
writer/reader. See http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Keynote-Duality</p>

<p>Arrays are the above, but plural. Generators are the
producing/writing/setting side, iterators are the read/get/consume.</p>

<p>Promises are singular and temporal. Promises are getters, and
corresponding setter is a resolver. Together, they&#8217;re a kind of
deferred.</p>

<p>Streams are a getter/setter pair of temporal plurals. Producer is a
writer and consumer is a reader. Reader is an async iterator and writer
is an async generator.</p>

<p>Remember that a value encapsulates a getter and setter&#8230; values are:
Deferred (promise + resolver, singular, temporal), Stream (reader +
writer, plural, temporal), Array (iterator + generator, spatial,
plural), and value (getter + setter, spatial, singular).</p>

<p>Promises (singular + temporal) model dependency. The API/experience of
multiple resolvers is the same regardless of who wins the race, and same
w consumers.</p>

<p>Because consumers cannot interfere with another consumer, aborting
promises is not possible; promise is only the result, not the work
leading to that result.</p>

<p>A task, similar to promise, but is unicast.</p>

<p>Unicast: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast - sending messages to a
  single destination</p>

<p>Broadcast: multiple possible destinations (or none)</p>

<p>Because tasks are unicast, consumers can&#8217;t clobber each other (because
there&#8217;s only one), hence they are cancellable. Can be explicitly forked
to create a task that depends on the same result</p>

<h2>CVV can mean lower rates</h2>

<p>http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/21168/how-does-amazon-bill-me-without-the-cvc-cvv-cvv2</p>

<p>There are fraud-prevention benefits to using CVV, and as such, payment
handlers will often give you a discount if the CVV is present.</p>

<h2>X-Forwarded-For</h2>

<p>Some servers fall prey to IP spoofing via setting the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>
header. If your server isn&#8217;t careful, then given a
<code>curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4" http://www.machty.com</code>, your
server&#8217;s logs and maybe even IP-dependent application logic (e.g.
language detection) might use 1.2.3.4.</p>

<p>In Rails you can add your known proxy/load-balancing IPs to
<code>TRUSTED_PROXIES</code>. Then the <code>RemoteIp</code> rack middleware will filter out
all of those and pick the most recently set IP, which handles the case
where you might have multiple <code>X-Fowarded-By</code> headers. So the rule is:
use the rightmost, untrusted IP and treat that as the remote ip. Why?
Because when your first proxy is hit, it&#8217;ll see IP X.X.X.X and move that
to the list of <code>X-Forwarded-By</code> headers. Note that the previous
<code>X-Forwarded-By</code> headers, present or no, are untrustable and totally
spoofable.</p>

<p>http://blog.gingerlime.com/2012/rails-ip-spoofing-vulnerabilities-and-protection</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s IP spoofing via HTTP header. How else can you IP spoof?</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing</p>

<p>You just rewrite the source IP in the TCP/UDP packet header, which also
means when the application responds, it&#8217;ll send it back to the forged
IP.</p>

<p>There are valid use cases for this as well, such as testing load
balancing software/hardware.</p>

<h2>Types of NAT</h2>

<p>http://think-like-a-computer.com/2011/09/16/types-of-nat/</p>

<h3>Full cone NAT (Static NAT) (port forwarding)</h3>

<p>Manual mapping of public IP and port to LAN IP and port.</p>

<p>e.g. all incoming traffic to port 12345, forward to 192.168.0.10:9999.</p>

<p>Blocks (drops connection):</p>

<ul>
<li>Ports that haven&#8217;t been forwarded</li>
</ul>


<h3>Restricted cone NAT (dynamic)</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t allow incoming data from an IP unless I&#8217;ve sent packets to it
already. Note that depending on the strictness, if I initiate a
connection to WAN IP 1.2.3.4:1234, I could potentially get data from
1.2.3.4:5678, but in stricter schemes, the port must also match.</p>

<p>But regardless of this strictness, the one requirement is that they send
data to exactly my public IP and port that I sent data out of.</p>

<h3>Symmetric NAT</h3>

<p>http://think-like-a-computer.com/2011/09/19/symmetric-nat/</p>

<p>Sym NAT is like port-restricted cone NAT, but randomly generates
different public source ports when sending to different destinations.</p>

<p>Sym NATs are the only ones that cause problems with other devices behind
NATs.</p>

<h2>Vim registers</h2>

<p>So if I have</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="WAT"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and I want to replace the href with a yanked &#8220;LOL&#8221;, then I can <code>di"</code> in
WAT to delete it, then <code>"0P</code> to use the last-yank register 0. Registers
1,2,3,4,5&#8230; get populated with cuts. Unnamed register gets replaced by
any yanking/cutting command. Weird terminology.</p>

<h2>Ember-cli + divshot</h2>

<p>Holy shit this was awesome.</p>

<p>Divshot.com is a static deployment heroku, basically, and ember-cli has
an addon for letting you deploy there.</p>

<pre><code>npm install --save-dev ember-cli-divshot &amp;&amp; ember generate divshot

		<h2>Incremental GC</h2>

<p>Tenderlove tweeted this: https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10137</p>

<ul>
<li>Generational GC already is implemented: distinguish/bucket old and new
generation objects; sweeping new generation objects is fast (minor GC), and the
ones that don&#8217;t get swept up get promoted to old generation, which is
less frequently swept (in a major GC)</li>
<li>Generation GC is always incremental in that it doesn&#8217;t collect ALL
unreachables, &#8230; todo http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5092134/whats-the-difference-between-generational-and-incremental-garbage-collection</li>

<h2>Ember First Class Actions</h2>

<p>http://emberjs.jsbin.com/ucanam/5919/edit</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>singleton vs multiples?</li>
<li>actions that depend on others?</li>
<li>link-to?

<ul>
<li>idea: a LinkView asks the router or url service for an Action
using the route params, query params, etc.</li>
<li>LinkView&#8217;s active CP is <code>action.pending</code> || present day isActive</li>
<li>action will internally delegate to a shared transitionTo action
that everyone in the world can see; everyone can know where it&#8217;s
going, etc etc etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>We need to separate fake link font decoration style from the underlying
action.</p>

<p>Link&#8217;s display components:</p>

<pre><code>routeDescriptor: function() {
  // when resolvedParams change, we need to recalculate
  // our route object... this should refire only when
  // params change, not when the URL changes
  this.urlService.getRouteObject('articles', 1)


  this.urlService.createRouteDescriptor({
    routeName: alias('_linkView.params.firstObject'),
    contexts: alias('_linkView.contexts'),
    queryParams: alias('_linkView.queryParams'),
    _linkView: this
  });
}//.property('resolvedParams')

createRouteDescriptor: function(_attrs) {
  var attrs = {
    router: this.router, // or maybe just `this`?
  };
  Ember.merge(attrs, _attrs);
  return RouteDescriptor.createWithMixins(attrs);
}

RouteDescriptor = Ember.Object.extend({
  // required
  router: null,
  routeName: null,
  contexts: null,
  queryParams: null,

  allParams: computed('routeName', 'contexts', 'queryParams', function() {
    // this is just a perfy thing; since all calculations depend
    // on all these params, we'll avoid the overhead of multiple
    // CPs depending on each of these params
    return this.getProperties(['routeName', 'contexts', 'queryParams']);
  }),

  path: computed('router.url', 'allParams', function() {
    var allParams = this.get('allParams');
    var router = this.get('router');

    // presently we only use router.url as a cue that the router
    // is at a new route
    var url = this.get('router.url');

    // pass crap to routerJS
  }),

  perform: function() {
    // invoke, blah blah blah, same logic as in link to.
    this.get('allParams');
  }
});

service.getRouteDescriptor('articles', 1)

{
  action:   FCA,
  isActive: true,
  path: "/some/dynamic/thing"
}
</code></pre>

<p>RouteDescriptors are objects</p>

<ul>
<li>inactive: !routeObject.active</li>
<li>active:   routeObject.active</li>
<li>visited</li>
</ul>


<p>Weird thing: ember link-to&#8217;s concept of &#8220;active&#8221; doesn&#8217;t match with
<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag&#8217;s concept of active; link-to &#8216;active&#8217; means you&#8217;re currently
in the route specified by that link; <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag&#8217;s active means you&#8217;re
currently clicking this link.</p>

<p>I think I know how to refactor link-to and LinkView and all that</p>

<p>Goals</p>

<ul>
<li>make linking/routing/active calc logic shareable</li>
<li>make it possible to click a link to make it active before a slow
transition has completed.</li>
<li>support calculating activeness for bootstrap wrapper <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s and
anything else in general too.</li>
</ul>


<h2>RFCs</h2>

<p>Rust tempered it&#8217;s freewheeling feature additions by requiring RFCs.</p>

<p>https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/active/0001-rfc-process.md
https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/active/0039-lifetime-elision.md</p>

<p>Sounds like we&#8217;ll be doing this for Ember.</p>

<h2>Elide</h2>

<blockquote><p>omit (a sound or syllable) when speaking: (as adj. elided) : the indication of elided consonants or vowels.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Variadic</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function</p>

<p>A function that is variadic has an indefinite number of arguments.
<code>.bind</code></p>

<blockquote><p>8:50 PM <spion> bind is variadic and I think it also has to do some stuff with constructors
8:51 PM <spion> (additional arguments can be used for partial application)
8:52 PM <spion> the constructor stuff: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Bound_functions_used_as_constructors
8:53 PM <spion> (creates significant additional overhead)
8:53 PM <spion> so a simple non-variadic closure implementation of bind has a lot less work to do :P</p></blockquote>

<p>Rationale: http://spoike.ghost.io/deconstructing-reactjss-flux/</p>

<h2>Promixo dedicated</h2>

<p>https://addons.heroku.com/proximo#dedicated</p>

<h2>CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing</p>

<p>Classful allocation of IP addresses (pre 1993) defined class A, B, C
network groups split along the 8 bit chunks. Problem is the smallest
allocation (256 addresses, assuming you were allocated something like
123.456.789.XXX) was often too small for companies, whereas the next
step up from that (123.456.XXX.XXX) was generally too huge (65536) for
companies/entities to efficiently take advantage of. SOLUTION: CIDR
blocks and subnet masks.</p>

<blockquote><p>This led to inefficiencies in address use as well as routing because the large number of allocated small (class-C) networks with individual route announcements, being geographically dispersed with little opportunity for route aggregation, created heavy demand on routing equipment.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, class C allocations are 123.456.789.XXX allocations,
each containing 256 addresses, with no requirement that they be
geographically grouped, such that routers had to maintain large tables
for very similar looking addresses rather than being able to rely on
some grouping rules to minimize the routing information they had to know
about. But now subnet masking is a thing and blah blah blah I&#8217;m done
learning this shit.</p>

<p>192.168.2.0/24 means that the network is identified by the first 24 bits</p>

<blockquote><p>192.168.100.0/24 represents the given IPv4 address and its associated routing prefix 192.168.100.0, or equivalently, its subnet mask 255.255.255.0 (i.e. 24 &#8220;1&#8221; bits).</p>

<p>the IPv4 block 192.168.100.0/22 represents the 1024 IPv4 addresses from 192.168.100.0 to 192.168.103.255.</p></blockquote>

<h2>TokenEx client-side encryption</h2>

<p>Original misconception:</p>

<ul>
<li>You post directly to TokenEx via AJAX, and they give you an encrypted
value that you can pass to your server and exchange for a token</li>
</ul>


<p>Correction:</p>

<ul>
<li>You only use JSEncrypt to encrypt the PAN via a public key.</li>
</ul>


<p>Wait, I don&#8217;t understand, with tokenizing, if you have a token saved in
the database, then your server, if compromised, could still send data
through to TokenEx, which would proxy it through to whomever.</p>

<h2>Form Factor</h2>

<p>https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Mobile_Payment_Security_Guidelines_Merchants_v1.pdf</p>

<blockquote><p>The PCI Security Standards Council charter provides a forum for collaboration across the payment space
to develop security standards and guidance for the protection of payment card data wherever it may be
stored, processed, or transmitted—regardless of the <em>form factor</em> or channel used for payment.</p></blockquote>

<p>the physical size and shape of a piece of computer hardware.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_form_factor</p>

<p>or phone.</p>

<p>what a stupid fucking phrase/word/definition.</p>

		<h2>NPM is killing me</h2>

<p>Apparently this fixed everything.</p>

<pre><code>npm cache clear &amp;&amp; npm install
</code></pre>

<p>https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-cache.html</p>

<p>npm caches everything in <code>npm config get cache</code>, which for me is:</p>

<pre><code>~/.npm
</code></pre>

<p>Folder structure is something like</p>

<pre><code>~/.npm/PACKAGE_NAME/VERSION/
</code></pre>

<p>which contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>.cache.json

<ul>
<li>lots of overlap w the project&#8217;s package.json, with additional
cache-specific things like</li>
<li>etag, shasum</li>
<li>deployment-specific data about the package</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>package.tgz

<ul>
<li>the original tarball downloaded for this packaage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>package/

<ul>
<li>the unzipped tarball</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words</p>

<blockquote><p>Additionally, whenever a registry request is made, a .cache.json file is placed at the corresponding URI, to store the ETag and the requested data. This is stored in {cache}/{hostname}/{path}/.cache.json.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wanted to switch to the fourth one without typing

number</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch | sed -n '4p' | xargs git checkout
Switched to branch 'setup-controller-qp'
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is just a dumb exercise since it&#8217;s waaay more typing.
This is me practicing.</p>

<p>You can also display multiple lines using a syntax similiar to cut&#8217;s
<code>-f1,2</code> syntax:</p>

  new-doctitle

pathname.  In addition, for each directory whose contents are dis-
played, the total number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the
directory is displayed on a line by itself, immediately before the
information for the files in the directory.  If the file or directory
has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l
option is followed by a '@' character.  Otherwise, if the file or
directory has extended security information (such as an access control

<h2>Interrupted System Call</h2>

<p>http://infohost.nmt.edu/~eweiss/222_book/222_book/0201433079/ch10lev1sec5.html</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting some shit about foreman and interrupted system calls. So
what is it.</p>

<h2>&#8220;data at the edge&#8221;</h2>

<p>Keeping secure data at the edge of your infrastructure, e.g. using
tokens instead of storing CC&#8217;s in your db.</p>

<h2>PAN (primary account number)</h2>

<p>Bank card number.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_account_number</p>

<h2>CP (card present)</h2>

<p>e.g AuthorizeNetCP</p>

<p>Cheaper rates if you can prove card present (via CVV).</p>

<h2>TokenEx</h2>

<p>ProcessTransaction</p>

<p>ProcessTransactionWithPAN</p>

<ul>
<li>pass in all the CC data; no</li>
</ul>


<h2>Levenshtein Distance</h2>

<p>The minimum number of single-element operations (add, remove,
substitute) between two sequences. Often used for spell-checking
suggestions.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using it to do an array diffing for React-ish stuff.</p>

<pre><code>Array 1: B C D E F
Array 2: A B C D E
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly the answer to how to get from 1 to 2 is</p>

<pre><code>shift A
delete E
</code></pre>

<p>But how to programmatically detect that?</p>

<h2>Ruby String Substring Shorthand</h2>

<p>https://speakerdeck.com/headius/jruby-the-hard-parts</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t know this&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>s = "alex is quite maudlin"
s['quite'] = 'very'
s =&gt; "alex is very maudlin"
</code></pre>

<p>and if the substring isn&#8217;t in there, then</p>

<pre><code>IndexError: string not matched
</code></pre>

<p>http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/String.html#method-i-5B-5D-3D</p>

<h2>JRuby the Hard Parts</h2>

<p>Goal: understand this talk https://speakerdeck.com/headius/jruby-the-hard-parts</p>

<h2>Learn about encodings</h2>

<p>I had to resort to this shit:</p>

<pre><code>line = line.force_encoding("iso-8859-1")
</code></pre>

<p>for a bigass file because I was running into</p>

<pre><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15399530/ruby-match-invalid-byte-sequence-in-utf-8

<p>Apparently you can open files as a certain encoding. Seems good.</p>
