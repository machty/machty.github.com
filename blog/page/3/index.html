		<h2>TL;DR on Android WebView Form Shit</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s a list of unsurmountable barriers involved when implementing
forms in a mobile web app in Cordova</p>

<ul>
<li>You <em>cannot</em> focus an input field on a setTimeout

<ul>
<li>It must be tied to a user input event (e.g. a touchstart/end)</li>
<li>It might look focused but it won&#8217;t bring up the keyboard</li>
<li>You can halfass get things working in cordova by using a plugin that
opens the keyboard before you tell the field to focus, but it you
lose all configurability of the keyboard (whether it&#8217;s numpad,
whether autocorrect is enabled, etc).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Android WebView</h2>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbOtn5VhGZU</p>

<p>Android Browser just uses a WebView (probably not Chrome).</p>

<p>Platform</p>

<ul>
<li>network, disk</li>
<li>system integration, e.g. HTML5 Camera integration</li>
<li>graphics and rendering; this is why differences exists b/w webkit</li>
<li>V8 is used in Android WebView instead of default webkit</li>
</ul>


<p>What is +1 dependent?</p>

<p>Render loop:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Event -> Paint -> Draw</p></li>
<li><p>Before Honeycomb (2012?)</p>

<ul>
<li>Paint loops are tight, they capture content into a Picture, and
then render the Picture</li>
<li>Picture is Vector representation of page, not just visible area</li>
<li>No need to go back to webkit when

<ul>
<li>scrolling</li>
<li>zooming</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multithreading

<ul>
<li>UI Thread (Picture)</li>
<li>WebCore Thread (webkit; generates a new Picture that UI thread can
use for zooming, scrolling, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software rendering

<ul>
<li>Slow, risk of taking longer than 16ms</li>
<li>CSS3D not supported in software</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Async rendering

<ul>
<li>e.g. flash, composited on top and often lagged behind scroll</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software doesn&#8217;t keep up w increasing size</li>
<li>Tiling via Hardware

<ul>
<li>Scroll event kicks off request for new tiles to render, if they
don&#8217;t arrive in time, no big deal, everything will be fast even if
there&#8217;s a moment where it&#8217;s blank</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Texture Generation Thread?

<ul>
<li>the thing that splits things into tiles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>w Hardware acceleration:

<ul>
<li>Painting slower, drawing (compositing?) faster!</li>
<li>Precache tiles

<ul>
<li>prefetch surrounding tiles</li>
<li>direction dependent (e.g. prefetch tiles below if you&#8217;re scrolling
down)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>low-res tiles when scrolling quickly&#8230; blur sharpens once it&#8217;s had
time to settle and finish painting</li>
<li>memory usage

<ul>
<li>limited number of tiles (device dependent)</li>
<li>tiles are 256x256</li>
<li>check if plain colors&#8230; JellyBean</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>AHH fuck it all it&#8217;s powered in Chromium now. Why bother.</p>

<h2>Android API levels</h2>

<p>http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels</p>

<p>API Levels are just integers that match up w Platform versions</p>

<pre><code>Platform Version    API Level   VERSION_CODE    Notes
Android 5.0 21  LOLLIPOP    Platform Highlights
Android 4.4W    20  KITKAT_WATCH    KitKat for Wearables Only
Android 4.4 19  KITKAT  Platform Highlights

<h2>Server-push</h2>

<p>http://caniuse.com/#feat=eventsource</p>

<p>Android supports SSE from 4.4 onward (since Nov 2013).</p>

<h2>Android Chromium WebView since 4.4 KitKat (Nov 2013)</h2>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOY2UNZU9QQ</p>

<p>Android Browser still uses WebView, just that it&#8217;s Chromium now.
Snapshot of Chrome 30.</p>

<p>Chrome vs Chrome WebView</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphics backend</li>
<li>Otherwise invisible to app developer</li>
<li>Chop out Chrome backend, replace w graphics stack compatible w android
graphics.</li>
<li>SurfaceFlinger</li>
<li>Hardware accelerated layers.</li>
</ul>


<p>KitKat webview is way more HTML5 compliant, rather than old WebKit
browser.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>IndexedDB (ios only has shitty/buggy support in 8+)

<ul>
<li>async, non-blocking, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Websockets</li>
<li>requestAnimationFrame</li>
<li>SVG filters and effects, sepia, convolution blurs</li>
<li>Hardware accelerated

<ul>
<li>everything</li>
<li>default for all new apps is hardware accelerated on</li>
<li>Question: hardware acceleration can be enabled for the app, but also
the webview itself?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>WebView methods must be run on UI Tthread, use <code>runOnUiThread</code> if you&#8217;re
within a different thread&#8230;</p>

<p>Compositing Thread,</p>

<p>Main UI thread</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986</a> since kitkat all urls
most conform to it.</p>

<p>A CSS pixel corresponds to 1, 2, 4, etc, depending on your viewport.</p>

<p>There must only be one Meta Viewport tag&#8230; only the last one is
actually used.</p>

<p>Shorthand CSS can override others in KitKit+; be specific w CSS
properties unless you really want to override many things.</p>

<h2>uses-sdk</h2>

<p>http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html</p>

<p>Always set target API, but you can still support min SDK versions for
fallback.</p>

<h2>lint</h2>

		<h2>Gaslighting</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting</p>

<p>Presenting false information to someone until they doubt their own sanity.</p>

<h2>Deductible</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible</p>

<p>The amount that must be paid by policy owner, out of pocket,
before insurance kicks in.</p>

<blockquote><p>Given the nature of medical treatment, the insured often faces multiple medical expenses spread over several days for a single illness or injury. Due to this reason, health insurance deductibles often tend to be imposed on a term basis (e.g. annually) as opposed to a per-visit threshold.[4] In spite of this, major medical insurance policies may have a per-visit excess which often does not cover the cost of routine visits to a GP, unless it is certified to be a part of a continuous treatment (and the bills can be collated in a single claim).</p></blockquote>

<p>So it&#8217;s annual so that you&#8217;re always paying <em>something</em> out of pocket.
Deductibles are ultimately limited by a Out-of-Pocket Maximum.</p>

<p>http://www.bcbsm.com/index/health-insurance-help/faqs/topics/how-health-insurance-works/deductibles-coinsurance-copays.html</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have $1500, and you get a $2000 medical bill, you have to pay
$1500 of that, no matter what, and then the last $500 might require
paying coinsurance

<ul>
<li>After deductible: insurance kicks in after deductible is paid</li>
<li>No deductible: insurance kicks in immediately without having to pay
a deductible (there could still be coinsurance)</li>
<li>Before deductible: you still have to pay deductible, but</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Ah ok so you&#8217;re still chipping away at a yearly deductible. After which
you only need to think about coinsurance and copay.</p>

<p>But first, deductible types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Annual: most common, chipping away at deductible throughout the year</li>
<li>Per-episode: min deductible to pay per each type of visit, e.g. each
time you&#8217;re hospitalized</li>
<li>Out of network deductible: what it sounds like; sometimes paying out
of network deductible subtracts from your regular deductible.</li>
<li>Family deductible: multiple members chipping away at deductible</li>
</ul>


<p>Coinsurance: your share of health care service costs, usually a
percentage. e.g. if you&#8217;ve paid your deductible, then you might have to
pay 20% of whatever&#8217;s left over.</p>

<p>Copay: a fixed amount you pay for a given service, each time you use it.
Could be $40 when you buy prescription drugs, $20 every doctor visit,
etc. Copays prevent frequent visits to the same person/service, since
they add up, particular if the service is cheap, whereas coisurance, a
fixed percentage, doesn&#8217;t add up if the service is cheap.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ul>
<li>You always know the fixed amount (rather than a percentage tied to
total cost)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>So the difference is just fixed amount vs percentage?</p>

<h2>Who is logged in what are they doing?</h2>

<p><code>w(1)</code>:</p>

<blockquote><p>w &#8211; display who is logged in and what they are doing</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>$ w

<h2>rcp, rsh, rcmd</h2>

<p>Non-secure scp, ssh, and rcmd. Uses kind of a crappy auth scheme,
wherein the server, rshd, has its <code>iruserok</code> fn called and can decide
based on IP, etc, whether things are cool.</p>

<p>TLDR use ssh.</p>

<h2>hub pull-request depends on -u upstream</h2>

<p>This used to create pull request from ember to ember</p>

<pre><code>hub pull-request
</code></pre>

<p>I had to do</p>

<pre><code>hub pull-request -h machty:some-crap
</code></pre>

<p>but if I <code>git push -u</code> then it&#8217;ll set the upstream and the original will
work. Hooray. Thanks Robert Jackson.</p>

<h2>bash hashes commands</h2>

<p>Because path resolution is slow, bash will hash the location of a
command. This broke my shit when I upgraded git from the Mac
(/usr/bin/git) to the one from homebrew (/usr/local/bin/git).</p>

<p>Bash has some built-ins <code>hash</code> and <code>type</code>. <code>type</code> tells you how a
command resolves:</p>

<pre><code>$ type git
git is hashed (/usr/local/bin/git)

$ hash
hits    command
   2    /usr/bin/which
   1    /usr/local/bin/node
   2    /Users/machty/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p353@global/bin/bundle
   3    /usr/local/bin/git
   1    /Users/machty/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb
  12    /usr/bin/man
   2    /bin/ls
   2    /usr/bin/rsh
   1    /bin/LS
   1    /usr/bin/w
   1    /usr/bin/dig
   1    /bin/rcp
</code></pre>

<p>And you can invalidate a cached command via <code>hash -r COMMAND</code>.</p>

		<h2>Zonebie</h2>

<p>https://github.com/alindeman/zonebie</p>

<p>Ruby gem to randomly change the current timezone to help catch bugs /
false assumptions in your timezone-touching code.</p>

<p>NOTE: trolled myself because i had a <code>_spec.rb</code> file that didn&#8217;t have
<code>require 'spec_helper'</code> at the top and hence Zonebie magic wasn&#8217;t
happening.</p>

<h2>Hellbanning</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbanning</p>

<p>Aka, shadowbanning. You don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re banned, but no one sees your
stuff, people stuff responding to you. Used on HN.</p>

<h2>Redis SLAVEOF</h2>

<p>http://redis.io/commands/slaveof</p>

<p>Master-slave replication. A slave has its own port, connects to parent
with SYNC, starts a BGSAVE, shares shit, blah blahblah.</p>

<p>You can even pretend to be a slave with netcat.</p>

<pre><code>nc localhost 9595
SYNC
</code></pre>

<p>And then you&#8217;ll get a stream of all the stuff a redis slave server sees.
If you write to the master you&#8217;ll the slave being sent that same write
request.</p>

<p>Slaves can have slaves. If a master disconnects, slaves become
masters&#8230;?</p>

<p>Slaves are read only:</p>

<pre><code>(error) READONLY You can't write against a read only slave.
</code></pre>

<p>If master disconnects, it&#8217;s still a slave until you tell it to
<code>SLAVE NO ONE</code>, then it severs that connection, preserving the
replicated data, and then the old master might connect to the new master
and invert the master-slave relationship. PRETTY RAD. Or you could also
tell the new master to become a slave, but that&#8217;ll mean it loses all of
its data.</p>

<p>Use slave chains if a master is overloaded w forwarding writes to all of
its slaves. Instead of</p>

<pre><code>- MASTER
  - SLAVE 0
  - SLAVE 1
  - SLAVE 2
  - SLAVE 3
</code></pre>

<p>You could do</p>

<pre><code>- MASTER
  - SLAVE 0
    - SLAVE 1
      - SLAVE 2
        - SLAVE 3
</code></pre>

<h2>Git: tags are a flat hierarchy</h2>

<p>You could release multiple versions of a project from different
branches. There&#8217;s no requirement that all the versions you tag are on
<code>master</code> or <code>release</code> or anything like that. Tags, as opposed to branch
names, are a flattened hiearchy.</p>

<p>A branch is just a pointer.</p>

<p>A tag is just a pointer.</p>

<p>The difference is that if you commit to a branch, the pointer moves. A
tag on the other hand stays pointing to that commit SHA.</p>

<p>A client can make sure a master write made it to slave via checking
UUID&#8217;s, and using <code>INFO</code> command to check sync status, etc.</p>

<h2>Redis Sentinel</h2>

<p>http://redis.io/topics/sentinel</p>

<p>Monitors master/slaves, restarts, notifies, failovers, etc.</p>

<h2>Redis-cli</h2>

<pre><code>-x                 Read last argument from STDIN.

Example:
cat /etc/passwd | redis-cli -x set mypasswd
</code></pre>

<p>So that sets <code>mypasswd</code> to the contents of a file.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "SOMEVALUE" | redis-cli -x set wat
OK
$ redis-cli get wat
</code></pre>

<h2>Redis: MULTI/EXEC doesn&#8217;t mean pipelining</h2>

<p>Pipelining refers to a redis client queueing commands and then sending
them to a Redis server all at once. The Redis server its has its own
concept of queued commands via MULTI/EXEC, but the concepts are separate;
you could invidually send a bunch of commands including MULTI/EXEC, and
get responses to each, but once you&#8217;re in the MULTI/EXEC block, you
start getting QUEUED as a response.</p>

<h2>Redis: WATCH, DISCARD, MULTI</h2>

<p>You can invalidate your own WATCH pretty immediately:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; WATCH foo
OK
127.0.0.1:6379&gt; SET foo wat
OK
127.0.0.1:6379&gt; MULTI
OK
127.0.0.1:6379&gt; EXEC
(nil)
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously you can&#8217;t put it in a MULTI</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; MULTI
OK
127.0.0.1:6379&gt; WATCH foo
(error) ERR WATCH inside MULTI is not allowed
</code></pre>

<p>DISCARDS must take place within MULTI block.</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; DISCARD
(error) ERR DISCARD without MULTI
</code></pre>

<h2>Optimistic Locking</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control</p>

<p>Redis implements optimistic locking; it never locks a datatype and
prevents someone from writing; rather, transactions can be aborted and
retried if it&#8217;s detected that someone else wrote to the same data
(detected via watch).</p>

<p>Pessimistic locking would be, say, if a DB row was locked and someone
wanting to write to it was blocked til the lock was given up, which
apparently most databases do.</p>

<p>Postgres (and other relational DBs) have other approaches:</p>

<p>http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-anti-patterns-read-modify-write-cycles/</p>

<p>TL;DR Avoid read-modify-write</p>

<h2>No pipelining + latency = multiplied awfulness</h2>

<p>Just like w TCP or anything with roundtrips, latency is the multiplier.
Good thing I wrote this.</p>

<h2>Standard Deviation</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#History</p>

<blockquote><p>The term standard deviation was first used[10] in writing by Karl Pearson[11] in 1894, following his use of it in lectures.</p></blockquote>

<p>So there&#8217;s no statistical meaning behind the word &#8220;standard&#8221;. We&#8217;re all
just talking about &#8220;deviation&#8221;, using the most basic/default/standard
way of calculating it.</p>

<h2>Ruby blocks v Python context manager</h2>

<p>One thing I noticed regarding <code>return</code>s:</p>

<pre><code>def foo():
  print(1)
  yield
  print(2)

def bar():
  with foo():
    print(999)
    return "LOL"
</code></pre>

<p>In python this yields</p>

<pre><code>1
999
2
</code></pre>

<p>and returns &#8216;LOL&#8217;. This is interesting because the <code>print(2)</code> is still
hit, which isn&#8217;t what would happen in Ruby.</p>

<pre><code>def foo
  puts 1
  yield
  puts 2
end

def bar
  foo { puts "999"; return "LOL" }
end
</code></pre>

<p>yields</p>

<pre><code>1
999
=&gt; "LOL"
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>2</code> isn&#8217;t printed because in Ruby, the return causes the caller to
return.</p>

<h2>Redis ZSETS sort by key when scores equal</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>

<h2>Lua</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)</p>

<p>Why use Lua:</p>

<ul>
<li>you&#8217;re building something that needs to be scriptable</li>
<li>that shouldn&#8217;t have a heavy footprint from the interpreter</li>
<li>that might be in an embedded system</li>
<li>that is easy to grok</li>
<li>that lots of people use already</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lua">Wikipedia is Lua-extensible</a></p>

<p>Redis offers Lua scripting now, useful in certain cases over
pipelining/multi-exec, since (I think) it allows logic to be placed on
the Redis server rather than having to do all logic on the application
sides and remembering to do all the WATCH/MULTI/EXEC crap.</p>

<h2>Redis: why lock?</h2>

<p>Because WATCH/retry loops quickly degrade as the number of actors
increase; particularly if the WATCH is coarse (only keys can be WATCH&#8217;d,
not specific items in a hash).</p>

<p>Instead of retrying, a lock might make sense in this case.</p>

<p>Implementing locks is error-prone:</p>

<ul>
<li>a process grabs a lock, but takes too long and the lock times out, and
process is blissfully unaware and keeps doing potentially destructive
things</li>
<li>process crashes, doesn&#8217;t releaes lock, and everyone wastes time
waiting for the timeout</li>
<li>process crashes, other blocked processes try to acquire lock at same
time, think they each got the lock. (This is an issue in general but
more likely to happen if many processes attempting-to-lock are blocked
at the same time)</li>
</ul>


<p>SETNX only writes if not already present. It&#8217;s a test and set. Useful
for locks. You can just spin-lock on a sleep(.001) loop.</p>

<p>Increasing the granularity of lock generally improves perf.</p>

<h2>Dogpiling</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_stampede</p>

<p>aka cache stampede; under very high loads, multiple processes try to
warm the cache at the same time, and performance takes a megahit.</p>

<p>This book seems to suggest a more general phenomenon of the system
taking a hit if lots of people are trying to acquire a lock. Probably
because they&#8217;re all spin locks, and spin lock take processing time.
Couldn&#8217;t we just implement a semaphore w BLPOP and LPUSH?</p>

			Redis the Slack-jawed Yokel</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some stores&#8217;ll never page to disk, but then again, some stores&#8217;ll, like
Redis, the slack-jawed yokel.</p>

<h2>Transparent Huge Pages</h2>

<p>https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Performance_Tuning_Guide/s-memory-transhuge.html</p>

<p>Huge pages are a Linux feature whereby pages, normally 4096 bytes,
can be 2MB or 1 GB. Useful for some applications, difficult to
configure, hence Transparent Huge Pages is provided automagically, I
guess. But it&#8217;s not recommended for database workloads&#8230; why not?</p>

<p>Probably Redis has the answer:</p>

<p>http://redis.io/topics/latency</p>

<p>Redis uses forking for</p>

<ul>
<li>generating RDB snapshot</li>
<li>rewriting AOF</li>
</ul>


<p>Forking is slower in certain virtual settings; EC2 old Xen instances
could take more than a second to fork. Newer ones using HVM
(hardware virtual machine) leverages assistive hardware to make this
efficient.</p>

<p>If you have transparent hugepages, they&#8217;ll need to be COW&#8217;d upon fork,
which is expensive. So you can disable them entirely:</p>

<pre><code>echo never &gt; /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
</code></pre>

<h2>Hypervisor / Virtual Machine Monitor</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor</p>

<p>Tis what it sounds like. It&#8217;s the thing that schedules processing time
b/w multiple virtual machines. It&#8217;s the host to the guest virtual
machines.</p>

<h2>Multiple values in sysfs</h2>

<p>http://techoverflow.net/blog/2013/08/01/how-to-check-if-hugepages-are-enabled-in-linux/</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
always [madvise] never
</code></pre>

<p>I thought this meant the first value (active) was the current value and
the other two were left as documentation, but no, it means madvise is
current value among the other two options. Kinda wacky. Who parses this?</p>

<p>IRC tells me this is a common sysfs pattern.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /sys/block/xvda/queue/scheduler
[noop]
</code></pre>

<h2>SSR</h2>

<p>Server-side render.</p>

<h2>InfoSec</h2>

<p>Information Security. Usually refers to IT security, but sometimes
physical backups play into it, such as off-site tape backups.</p>

<h2>Which process is using which port?</h2>

<pre><code>lsof -i $PORT
# e.g.
lsof -i :5000
</code></pre>

<p><code>-i</code> just means filter by internet address. The above supplied only a
port, you could also provide a host name.</p>

<h2>Redis Pub Sub</h2>

<p>Not super common because</p>

<ul>
<li>older versions might crash system / OS if clients don&#8217;t read published
messages fast enough, back pressure, bloating outgoing buffer. New
versions disconnect slow readers though.</li>
<li>Unreliable message delivery if there&#8217;s an intermittent disconnect and
reconnect.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Redis Expiration</h2>

<ul>
<li>you can manually DEL or use expiration</li>
<li>expires whole keys, i.e. can&#8217;t expire individual items in a set (hence
more common to use ZSETs with timestamps and manual deletion based on
a range)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Stripe Token Retrieval</h2>

<p>https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_token</p>

<p>This is only interesting since it clarified that a token wraps a card
with details that you can access before you, say, add it to a card.
This is the only way presently to prevent attaching the same card
to a customer twice: retrieve and then add.</p>

<p>But for my purposes I can just add it twice, and check the fingerprint
after word to prevent duplicates on my app&#8217;s Customer obj.</p>

<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Stripe de-dup? https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stripe.com/forum/#!topic/api-discuss/OzmhpQOs_SU</p>

<blockquote><p>We do not check, as many people have their own policies around when
duplicates are acceptable or aren&#8217;t.
However, you can look at the &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; property on cards that you
have saved in order to dedup.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ruby Enumerators are awesome</h2>

<p>&#8220;Hey how come there&#8217;s <code>each_with_index</code> but not <code>map_with_index</code>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Use enumerators. Lots of the Ruby Enumerables return enumerators if you
don&#8217;t pass a block to them, and they can be chained. For instance you
can create a 1-indexed series via:</p>

<pre><code>10.times.map { |i| i+1 }
</code></pre>

<p>Does this work with lazy enumerators?</p>

<pre><code>(0..Float::INFINITY).lazy.map { |i| i + 1 }.first(10)
</code></pre>

<p>So yeah, just that ranges have no <code>times</code>&#8230; probably more correct to
think of <code>10.times</code> as a range rather than other way around.</p>

<h2>Stripe Checkout is only Web</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s no native ios/android version of Stripe Checkout. It&#8217;s just web.
iOS/Android SDKs offer token exchange utilities and some widgets but
it&#8217;s not the full tailored UI solution that Checkout is.</p>

<h2>Stripe passes through failed CVVs</h2>

<p>https://support.stripe.com/questions/cvc-or-avs-failed-but-payment-succeeded</p>

<p>You can still process a card with the wrong CVV. Though you probably
shouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Test:</p>

<blockquote><p>4000000000000101: cvc_check will fail.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Rx state machine</h2>

<p>https://github.com/logicalguess/rx-state-machine</p>

<p>Basically every transition that occurs maps to a new state machine. You
define a state machine in a classic OO manner but it streamifies it for
you.</p>

<h2>Write amplification w SSDs</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_amplification</p>

<p>When the amount you write to an SSD is amplified by the fact that you
often have to flash much more than you originally intended to write
based on how SSD works. So you wanna be careful about abusing <code>fsync</code>.
Ramdisks might help too.</p>

<h2>MySQL installation n00bness</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s <code>mysql</code> and <code>mysql-server</code>. They&#8217;re separate packages. Derp.
One can connect to a server and issue commands, one actually installs
the database.</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
</code></pre>

<p><code>mysqld_safe</code> is a script for starting up the daemon (as opposed to
<code>service mysqld start</code>?).</p>

<pre><code>cd /usr ; /usr/bin/mysqld_safe &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently it&#8217;s helpful because it:</p>

<ul>
<li>restarts the server upon error</li>
<li>runtime logging</li>
</ul>


<p>Apparently MySQL on Linux stores the DB files in</p>

<pre><code>/var/lib/mysql/
</code></pre>

<p>There&#8217;s a secure install script that does a few things:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Encourages you to set root password</li>
<li>Require <code>root</code> login must come from <code>localhost</code>; disable remote
logins.</li>
<li>Delete test database</li>
<li>Reload perms table.</li>
</ol>


<h2>PHP FPM</h2>

<p>http://php-fpm.org/</p>

<p>A simple and robust FastCGI Process Manager for PHP</p>

<p>I think this is necessary if you do nginx + php (apache has built in
niceties w php).</p>

<p>I already wrote about this shit and forgot it again:</p>

<blockquote><p>CGI applications are processes spun up by a web server to handle an
incoming request. Unscalable since spinning up processes all the time
takes a toll on the OS, not to mention that there&#8217;s no way to do
resource sharing (DB connection sharing, in-memory caching (because
the process dies at the end of request)).</p>

<p>With FastCGI, there&#8217;s a persisting FastCGI server that owns all of the
CGI programs, and webservers interact with FastCGI via a binary protocol
(over a socket (local) or TCP connection (remote)).</p></blockquote>

<p>So FPM is the thing that stays up and running, and may spawn PHP
instances, but can do the connection sharing.</p>

<h2>WordPress FPM</h2>

<p>http://codingsteps.com/install-php-fpm-nginx-mysql-on-ec2-with-amazon-linux-ami/</p>

<pre><code>location / {
    root   /var/www/html;
    index  index.php index.html index.htm;
}
location ~ \.php$ {
      fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
      fastcgi_index  index.php;
      fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /usr/share/nginx/
                       html$fastcgi_script_name;
      include        fastcgi_params;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why location and not server? Isn&#8217;t this gonna be required within
nginx.conf? I guess server means a proxy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s expecting this include to be within a server
directive. Which I don&#8217;t want. I want simultaneous blogs, yo.</p>

<p>AH OK figured it out:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>server</code> doesn&#8217;t just mean a proxy; it means nginx will spin up such a
server, bind to the ports, and then proxy or serve the thing itself or
pass to FastCGI, however you&#8217;ve configured it. <code>server</code> must be
within the <code>http</code> context.</li>
<li><code>location</code> must be within <code>server</code> or nested within <code>location</code>
context.</li>
</ul>


<p>So we have</p>

<pre><code>location / { ...
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>location ~ \.php$ { ... 
</code></pre>

<p>So the first matches root. The second case-insensitive matches anything
ending in .php.</p>

<h2>Nginx FastCGI</h2>

<p>FastCGI is a binary protocol. Nginx implements that protocol. Just in
the same way nginx can match a URL and proxy through to an underlying
server, nginx can match a URL and proxy through to a FastCGI server.</p>

<p>There might be multiple FastCGI-speaking servers that nginx might talk
to. PHP-FPM is an alternative implementation over the default FastCGI.</p>

<p>Nginx won&#8217;t spin up a fastCGI server (in the same way it won&#8217;t spin up a
proxy server that it proxies requests to), but rather expects it to be
already running and answering requests from a unix socket or internet socket.</p>

<p>A fast-cgi process is a process manager. It might spin up 8 worker
instances of, say, php, and reuse these instances efficiently. It might
feature adaptive process spawning, like PHP-FPM does, or it might just
block one request if N+1 requests arrive at the same time. Either way,
it&#8217;s better than:</p>

<ol>
<li>Constant process starting/stopping that plain of CGI entails</li>
<li>Building PHP into apache (<code>mod_php</code>), which means you can&#8217;t restart
PHP (after, say, an upgrade) without restarting Apache. Also, you
lose permissions granularity if it&#8217;s built into Apache, which opens
security holes that could be closed by letting PHP run at a different
uid/group, etc.</li>
</ol>


<p>So what&#8217;s PHP FPM?</p>

<h2>Nginx index causing internal redirect</h2>

<p>http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_index_module.html#index</p>

<p>It should be noted that using an index file causes an internal redirect, and the request can be processed in a different location. For example, with the following configuration:</p>

<p>Interesting. That&#8217;s how you can make a <code>/</code> behave like a PHP and be
processed like a PHP.</p>

<h2>Configure PHP-FPM to create unix domain socket with nginx owner/user</h2>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23443398/nginx-error-connect-to-php5-fpm-sock-failed-13-permission-denied</p>

<p>You can configure php-fpm to create a unix domain socket and chown it
to a different user/group. Since nginx workers need to talk to it, it
should be configured to their user/group, which was <code>nginx</code> for me.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m getting &#8220;No input file specified.&#8221;</p>

<p>LONG STORY SHORT I was pointing to home/some-user/sites/wordpress and
unless you&#8217;re root, that&#8217;s inaccessible.</p>

<h2>PHP config</h2>

<p>https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-on-ubuntu-12-04</p>

<p>They want me to change <code>cgi.fix_pathinfo</code> to 0, else it will be fuzzy
match a php file for processing, a potential security risk.</p>

<p>Then I have to change PHP FPM to accept requests off a unix domain
socket:</p>

<pre><code>listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock
</code></pre>

<p>Makes sense, otherwise it assumes the fast cgi server is localhost 9000.</p>

<p>So&#8230; does nginx spin up a FastCGI server? Is it part of nginx? Is it
just a protocol?</p>

<h2>System V Services</h2>

<p>You don&#8217;t directly start mysqld, you do</p>

<pre><code>service mysqld start
</code></pre>

<h2>CentOS</h2>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS</p>

<p>Largely a clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>

<p>http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27323/is-centos-exactly-the-same-as-rhel</p>

<blockquote><p>CentOS is very close to being RHEL without the branding and support. In particular, the library versions are the same, so binaries that work on one will work on the other. The administration tools are the same and configured in similar ways. However, there are a few differences, as the two distributions sometimes apply different minor patches. For example, in this question, it was apparent that RHEL 5 and CentOS 5 apply different rules to identify files under /etc/cron.d.</p>

<p>In other words, at the level of your course, you can treat CentOS and RHEL as interchangeable. But if you needed to look up the precise behavior of a program in a corner of the man page, you may encounter differences.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Alice in Flames</h2>

<p>http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/11/nodejs-in-flames.html</p>

<p>Flame chart things I didn&#8217;t know:</p>

<ul>
<li>X axis isn&#8217;t necessarily passage of time; I think it is in Chrome but
doesn&#8217;t need to be for purposes of flame chart?</li>
<li>Width of a box is aggregate call time;</li>
</ul>


<p>Ehh I guess flame charts do different things? Seems that chrome X axis
is in order. But it doesn&#8217;t need to be, in the same way that the tree
view of calls isn&#8217;t in time order; you care about total elapsed time,
not passage of time.</p>

<h2>Heroku one-off dynos</h2>

<p>https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos</p>

<p>TL;dr heroku run console (and any other run) will use a one-off dyno.</p>

<h2>Sampling vs Tracing</h2>

<p>https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/webhelp/Profiling_Guidelines__Choosing_the_Right_Profiling_Mode.html</p>

<p>Sampling vs Tracing.</p>

<p>TL;DR tracing is more expensive, affects perf, but is more accurate than
sampling.</p>

<h2>Wordpress Admin on SSL</h2>

<p>http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Over_SSL</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re reverse-proxying, you have to prevent loops via:</p>

<pre><code>define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);
if ($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https')
       $_SERVER['HTTPS']='on';
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that wp-config.php is going to be loaded on every stupid thing.
Right?</p>

<h2>Heroku buildpacks</h2>

<p>Integration-tested via <a href="https://github.com/heroku/hatchet">Hatchet</a>.</p>

<p>https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-api</p>

<ul>
<li>detect: determines whether to apply buildpack to app</li>
<li>compile: apply the transformations</li>
<li>release: provides metadata back to runtime&#8230;?</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want both a node and ruby setup, you can do</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi
</code></pre>

<p>and point to the default heroku-provided buildpacks within a .buildpacks
file.</p>

<h2>nginx-buildpack</h2>

<p>https://github.com/ryandotsmith/nginx-buildpack/blob/master/bin/start-nginx</p>

<p>This is a pretty awesome file that uses lots of Linux-y IPC trickery to
get</p>

<p>You must put the following in your Procfile:</p>

<pre><code>web: bin/start-nginx bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb
</code></pre>

<p>The start-nginx script spins up processes in the background; nginx
will wait for</p>

<h2>App server</h2>

<p>Unicorn, Puma, Rainbows, zbatery, etc. It&#8217;s the thing that listens to a
socket and runs your application code for you. Rails isn&#8217;t an app
server, but Puma running a rails app is. Rails is an app framework. Puma is
an app server.</p>

		<h2>Redis&#8217;n</h2>

<p>This and other notes based on Redis in Action.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is it really brag-worthy to say in-memory-store? It gets persisted to
disk anyway; don&#8217;t other DBs bring as much into memory as possible for
fast lookups?

<ul>
<li>A: other databases are &#8220;primarily on-disk&#8221; but of course yes memory
caching exists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Relation to memcached:</p>

<ul>
<li>Similar efficiency based on in-memory lookups</li>
<li>Redis features 2 persistence strategies (memcached doesn&#8217;t persist I
guess?)</li>
<li>Redis supports strings + 4 other data structures; memcached is strings</li>
</ul>


<p>ZSETs are hash of string keys to floating points, can be queried by
order, ordered by their weight.</p>

<h2>Databases: row insertion (often) fast</h2>

<p>Because no need for a random read + random write; appending to a file
(what most DBs do) is fast.</p>

<h2>ACID</h2>

<p>Set of properties that guarantee reliable database transactions</p>

<ul>
<li>Atomicity - all or nothing</li>
<li>Consistency - transactions bring database from one valid state to another</li>
<li>Isolation - are partially completed transaction visible to others?</li>
<li>Durability - post-transaction, data is committed even in power loss</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fortnight</h2>

<p>Two weeks.</p>

<h2>Heroku database URL</h2>

<pre><code>postgres://username:password@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d45d81ucgm3205
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s just username + password at some publicly accessible EC2 URL. Your
cherished postgres instances just live on some EC2 farm. What a crock.</p>

<h2>Docker</h2>

<p>Docker images are read-only templates. Use them to generate containers.
Build other shit on top of containers.</p>

<p>Docker has its own IANA port numbers for REST and secure REST API&#8230;
what does this actually mean?</p>

<p>http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=docker#DOCKER</p>

<p>AH OK I have some more ideas:</p>

<p>Boot2Docker is what you use to run Docker on Mac OS X. Why? Because
docker depends on linux kernel specifics. Boot2Docker runs a Virtual Box
instance of some Linux-y thing</p>

<pre><code># within the virtual instance
$ uname
Linux version 3.16.4-tinycore64 (root@39d2c877bc4f) (gcc version 4.7.2 (Debian 4.7.2-5) ) #1 SMP Thu Oct 23 16:14:24 UTC 2014
</code></pre>

<p>So with the Boot2Docker setup, when you run the <code>docker</code> command on a
Mac terminal, it has to jump through some hoops to run the docker
instance on the Linux virtual box:</p>

<pre><code>Mac `docker` command
Proxy through to docker:tcuser@192.168.59.103
Run `docker` command, which talks to 
docker daemon
</code></pre>

<p>So there&#8217;s no docker daemon on OS X; the only persistent docker thing
you&#8217;ll see is Virtual box instances running the docker virtual instance
that the actual docker daemon lives on:</p>

<pre><code> /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxHeadless --comment boot2docker-vm --startvm 798082c7-01d7-4a4f-89fc-1ebf70bc1a0a --vrde config
 /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxNetDHCP --ip-address 192.168.59.99 --lower-ip 192.168.59.103 --mac-address 08:00:27:93:D3:BC --netmask 255.255.255.0 --network HostInterfaceNetworking-vboxnet0 --trunk-name vboxnet0 --trunk-type netadp --upper-ip 192.168.59.254
</code></pre>

<p>You can ssh into the docker VM box. Either w password or reusing the key
they generate for you when you install boot2docker; put this in
~/.ssh/config</p>

<pre><code>Host docker
  HostName 192.168.59.103
  User docker
  IdentityFile "/Users/machty/.ssh/id_boot2docker"
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>

<p>(I realized later that there&#8217;s a convenient command for this:
<code>boot2docker ssh</code>&#8230; whoops!)</p>

<p>So with this config in place I&#8217;m guessing that I can either run
<code>docker version</code> or <code>ssh docker docker version</code> and see the same
thing. BOOYA both produce:</p>

<pre><code>Client version: 1.3.1
Client API version: 1.15
Go version (client): go1.3.3
Git commit (client): 4e9bbfa
OS/Arch (client): linux/amd64
Server version: 1.3.1
Server API version: 1.15
Go version (server): go1.3.3
Git commit (server): 4e9bbfa
</code></pre>

<p>So anyway, you can run commands against a docker image. This spins up a
container, runs the command, and stops the container&#8230; does it delete
the container?</p>

<pre><code>docker ps --help
</code></pre>

<p>Nevermind that I&#8217;ll figure it out later. Let&#8217;s figure out how to get a
Redis container running:</p>

<pre><code>https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/redis/
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>docker build</code> to build from a Dockerfile, which kinda explains how
it ends up getting mounted to the outside world. So this is how you can
just have a docker instance of a thing that you can run commands
against, even in a Mac OS X setting? I know nothing, Jon Snow.</p>

<p>https://docs.docker.com/examples/running_redis_service/</p>

<pre><code>FROM        ubuntu:12.10
RUN         apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y redis-server
EXPOSE      6379
ENTRYPOINT  ["/usr/local/bin/my-dumbass-redis-server"]
</code></pre>

<p>So this starts with the ubuntu:12.10 image, installs redis into the
container created from that image, exposes 6379&#8230; to&#8230;? What does this
mean?</p>

<blockquote><p>The EXPOSE instructions informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified network ports at runtime. Docker uses this information to interconnect containers using links (see the Docker User Guide). Note that EXPOSE only works for inter-container links. It doesn&#8217;t make ports accessible from the host. To expose ports to the host, at runtime, use the -p flag.</p></blockquote>

<p>From http://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s exposed if we&#8217;re linking containers but not someone exposed to
the host app.</p>

<p>Ah I tried</p>

<pre><code>docker run -i --entrypoint=/usr/bin/redis-server dcf91
</code></pre>

<p>and then I couldn&#8217;t ctrl-C because of, something, but if i do</p>

<pre><code>docker run -it --entrypoint=/usr/bin/redis-server dcf91
</code></pre>

<p>then the -t option will attach a pseudo TTY and I can do it. This
stuff is so cray cray. Actually I lied ctrl-C doesn&#8217;t work for TODO
reasons, but Ctrl-P + Ctrl-Q detaches you from it? Seems good.</p>

<p>OK but if I do</p>

<pre><code>docker run -it -p 9191:6379 --entrypoint=/usr/bin/redis-server dcf91
</code></pre>

<p>this will run in interactive mode with ctrl-p ctrl-q supporting
detachability, mapping the container 6379 (default redis port) to the
host port 9191, and overriding the entrypoint because I didn&#8217;t know what
I was doing in the Dockerfile. I should have left it at the default
/usr/bin/redis-server because that&#8217;s where apt-get will put it.</p>

<p>ANYWAY the mapping works, but the problem is i have to SSH into the
docker host VirtualBox first to see it. How do I get beyond the
Boot2Docker wall? Wait I know I&#8217;ll just fuckin use some SSH magic.
Tunnels n shit.</p>

<pre><code>ssh docker -L 9191:localhost:9191
</code></pre>

<p>ah but this will open a login shell, which I don&#8217;t need/want for what
I&#8217;m doing:</p>

<pre><code>ssh docker -N -L 9191:localhost:9191
</code></pre>

<p>The -N stands for &#8220;Do not execute a remote command&#8221;</p>

<p>After which point I could just redis-cli but since I&#8217;m brutally low
level I&#8217;ll do</p>

<pre><code>$ nc localhost 9191
SET WAT WOOT
+OK
GET WAT
$4
WOOT
</code></pre>

<p>Booooooya. So cool.</p>

<p>OK gonna be an idiot. SSH all the way. Is that possible? It means being
able to SSH into container&#8230; sounds like you can&#8217;t do that without
going through</p>

<h2>Docker detach</h2>

<p>Docker attaching/detaching is pretty weird. I don&#8217;t know the rationale
behind it but they make it very easy to attach to a box but then not be
able to attach. Basically you have to always pass -it to run and then
can use ctrl-P ctrl-Q to detach.</p>

<p>Or, you can <code>kill -9</code> the attached processed; if you you just do <code>kill</code>,
that sends SIGTERM and that proxies through and closes the shitty
process, but again Ctrl-C doesn&#8217;t use it.</p>

<h2>Docker forwarding for OS X</h2>

<p>This is a great article</p>

<p>http://viget.com/extend/how-to-use-docker-on-os-x-the-missing-guide</p>

<p>Things learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>boot2docker ssh</code></li>
<li>Add <code>dockerhost</code> to /etc/hosts</li>
<li>Use <code>nsenter</code>

<ul>
<li><code>sudo nsenter -m -u -n -i -p -t $PID</code>

<ul>
<li><code>-m</code> use mount namespace of target process</li>
<li><code>-u</code> use UTS namespace of target process (UTS stands for time-sharing? legacy unix thing?)</li>
<li><code>-n</code> use network namespace of target process</li>
<li><code>-i</code> IPC</li>
<li><code>-i</code> IPC</li>
<li><code>-p</code> IPC</li>
</ul>

<h2>LXC Containers (vs Docker)</h2>

<p>https://linuxcontainers.org/</p>

<p>Better chroot, comparable to docker containers. Ways of containing
processes, resources, etc., dependent on modern linux kernel features,
mostly on process namespacing.</p>

<p>Excellent article comparing to Docker: http://www.flockport.com/lxc-vs-docker/</p>

<p>Things learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>yuno virtualization?

<ul>
<li>because of performance cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LXC and Docker are fast</li>
<li>Lightweight VMs</li>
<li>Is Docker a lightweight VM?</li>
</ul>


<p>A Docker container runs a single process:</p>

<blockquote><p>Docker restricts the container to a single process only. The default docker baseimage OS template is not designed to support multiple applications, processes or services like init, cron, syslog, ssh etc. As you can imagine this introduces a certain amount of complexity and has huge implications for day to day usage scenarios. Since current architectures, applications and services are designed to operate in normal multi process OS environments you would need to find a Docker way to do things or use tools that support Docker. When it comes to applications for a LAMP container you would need to build 3 containers that consume services from each other, a PHP container, an Apache container and a MySQL container. Can you build all 3 in one container? You can, but there is no way to run php-fpm, apache and mysqld in the same container without a shell script or install a separate process manager like runit or supervisor.</p></blockquote>

<p>http://docs.docker.com/articles/using_supervisord/</p>

<blockquote><p>Traditionally a Docker container runs a single process when it is launched, for example an Apache daemon or a SSH server daemon.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the entry point. Note that <code>ubuntu</code> has no entry point. Not sure
if it&#8217;s possible to use <code>run</code> with a container that has an entry point,
since the entry point is the process that gets run.</p>

<p>So it should be possible for me to run an ubuntu netcat and portforward
at the same time:</p>

<p>All from Mac:</p>

<pre><code>$ docker run -i -p 9292:9292 --expose=[9292] ubuntu:14.04 nc -l 0.0.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>9292</p>

<p>Separate Mac terminal window:</p>

<pre><code>$ nc dockerhost 9292
</code></pre>

<p>And now these two assholes talk to each other!</p>

<p>Here are all the options I used</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-i</code>: run container interactively with terminal attached; without
this, nc immediately closes once someone connects to it since STDIN is
presumably dev null</li>
<li><code>-p 9292:9292</code>, map docker host port 9292 to container port 9292</li>
<li><code>--expose=[9292]</code> open the firewall since it wasn&#8217;t listed as exposed
in the dockerfile</li>
</ul>


<p>Shit is SO COOL.</p>

<h2>Docker vs Heroku</h2>

<p>Hmm, not even worth comparing.</p>

<h2>Nested SSH tunnels</h2>

<p>http://superuser.com/questions/96489/ssh-tunnel-via-multiple-hops</p>

<p>Map localhost:9998 to host2&#8217;s port 22.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -L 9998:host2:22 -N host1
</code></pre>

<p>Map localhost:9999 to blahbalhbablh you get the picture.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -L 9999:localhost:1234 -N -p 9998 localhost
</code></pre>

<p>Shit is sooooo crazy. I love this stuff.</p>

<h2>ProxyCommand</h2>

<p>From <code>SSH_CONFIG(5)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> ProxyCommand
         Specifies the command to use to connect to the server.  The command string
         extends to the end of the line, and is executed with the user's shell.  In the
         command string, any occurrence of `%h' will be substituted by the host name to
         connect, `%p' by the port, and `%r' by the remote user name.  The command can be
         basically anything, and should read from its standard input and write to its
         standard output.  It should eventually connect an sshd(8) server running on some
         machine, or execute sshd -i somewhere.  Host key management will be done using
         the HostName of the host being connected (defaulting to the name typed by the
         user).  Setting the command to ``none'' disables this option entirely.  Note
         that CheckHostIP is not available for connects with a proxy command.

         This directive is useful in conjunction with nc(1) and its proxy support.  For
         example, the following directive would connect via an HTTP proxy at 192.0.2.0:

            ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p
</code></pre>

<p>So this proxies through an already established HTTP Connect proxy at
192.0.2.0:8080. That&#8217;s so awesome.</p>

<p>netcat even brags of this:</p>

<pre><code> Common uses include:

       o   simple TCP proxies
       o   shell-script based HTTP clients and servers
       o   network daemon testing
       o   a SOCKS or HTTP ProxyCommand for ssh(1)
       o   and much, much more
</code></pre>

<h2>get.docker.com</h2>

<pre><code>curl https://get.docker.com
</code></pre>

<p>It returns a bootstrapping shell script for setting up docker.</p>

<p>You can <code>#include</code> it when booting an EC2 instance. Pretty cool.</p>

<h2>Basic Authentication</h2>

<p>If I spin up a stupid netcat server</p>

<pre><code>nc -l localhost 9191
</code></pre>

<p>and then query it from Chrome</p>

<pre><code>http://user:password@localhost:9191
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I see:</p>

<pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9191
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/38.0.2125.122 Safari/537.36
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Cookie: blahblah
</code></pre>

<p>No reference to <code>user</code> or <code>password</code>. Which means that this information
isn&#8217;t sent up front unless the server requests basic authentication by
first sending back a 401 with the <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header, after which
point the user and password will be sent.</p>

<p>And because it&#8217;s sent as a header (user:pass in base64) it&#8217;s encrypted
if sent over TLS. But it&#8217;ll be plaintext in your address bar :).</p>

<h2>SSH randomart</h2>

<p>You see it when you create a key pair. Why? Because it&#8217;s just an easy
ass visual way to compare keys rather than some Base64 shit.</p>

<p>You can see the randomart for an existing key by printing the
fingerprint in verbose mode:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -lv -f ~/.ssh/id_boot2docker.pub
2048 b2:3e:e4:d3:c1:9d:1b:75:46:0b:53:aa:18:6b:c7:c6  machty@machty.home (RSA)

		<h2>Linux hierachy layout</h2>

<p><code>man hier</code> answers these questions.</p>

<p>Basically, <code>/usr</code> is a secondary hierarchy for libs/bins/other things
that aren&#8217;t strictly required for single-user mode (e.g. root).</p>

<p><code>/usr/local</code> is tertiary. Things you compile yourself might belong
there. Typically implies lower level of permissions. Rationale for
separting from <code>/usr</code> is that <code>/usr</code> might be some read-only thing
mounted and shared across machines, ready to be swapped out and upgraded
at any time, but <code>/usr/local</code> is crap that you can fuck wit.</p>

<p><code>brew</code> expects to install in the tertiary <code>/usr/local</code> directory:
<code>/usr/local/Cellar</code>. So you can have multiple versions of executables
installed via brew, but only one wins on the command line by way of
symlinks within <code>/usr/local/bin</code> pointing to specific executables in
<code>/usr/local/Cellar/projectname/1.23/bleh</code>. Symlinks to the rescue.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo brew install wat
Error: Cowardly refusing to `sudo brew install`
You can use brew with sudo, but only if the brew executable is owned by root.
However, this is both not recommended and completely unsupported so do so at
your own risk.
</code></pre>

<p>I guess this is nice since it prevents all the ugliness of installing
shared executables at root privileges when they&#8217;re not needed.</p>

<h2>Raptor</h2>

<p>Ruby server. Apparently fast.</p>

<p>http://www.rubyraptor.org/how-we-made-raptor-up-to-4x-faster-than-unicorn-and-up-to-2x-faster-than-puma-torquebox/#zero_copy</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses nginx HTTP parser

<ul>
<li>due to battle-tested reliability</li>
<li>could have used PicoHTTPParser, but not much community adoption
though it claims being faster than nginc</li>
<li>could have used Mongrel&#8217;s Ragel HTTP parser, but lots of
Ruby-specific</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Comes w reverse proxy buffer, such as what nginx has but hyper
optimized to typical ruby raptor workflows</li>
<li>Multi-process</li>
<li>Sounds like multi-threadedness will be a paid solution that comes
later.</li>
</ul>


<p>The C++ component of Raptor is the server that consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buffering reverse proxy</li>
<li>HTTP parser</li>
<li>HTTP server</li>
</ul>


<p>Apparently these are all part of the same thing.</p>

<h2>Puma Lopez mode</h2>

<p>Puma Ruby server comes with a Lopez mode named after <code>@brianmario</code> who
suggested it. It&#8217;s a tcp-only (no http) version of puma. To that guy&#8217;s
knowledge Puma is the only threaded/pre-forking Ruby server that offers
such a mode.</p>

<h2>nginx Reverse proxy buffer</h2>

<p>http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffering</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s on by default, but you can disable it, configure buffer
sizes, or enable with <code>X-Accel-Buffer</code>.</p>

<h2>nginx in general</h2>

<ul>
<li>master process

<h2>30s write delay</h2>

<p>http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html</p>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13650134/after-how-many-seconds-are-file-system-write-buffers-typically-flushed</p>

<p>http://brad.livejournal.com/2116715.html</p>

<p>Modified kernel buffers (of files on disk) wait up to 30s to be flushed
to disk. You can &#8220;force&#8221; it was fsync. But then your disks might lie to
you about what actually was persisted (verifiable via a test involving
pulling the power cord).</p>

<h2>Redis persistence</h2>

<p>http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html</p>

<p>It&#8217;s in-memory key-value, so does it ever get saved to disk?</p>

<p>Why yes it does, via:</p>

<ul>
<li>snapshotting; configure min writes since last sync, or a timeout, and
it&#8217;ll persist a snapshot to a .rdb file. Half completed transactions
(via MULTI/EXEC) don&#8217;t show up of course.</li>
<li>append-only AOF files

<ul>
<li>get rewritten based on memory contents if file grows too large</li>
<li>possible for an empty redis db (written and then deleted keys) has a
large AOF file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Both can be enabled; it&#8217;s nice to have rdb files that you can back up.</p>

<blockquote><p>AOF rewrites are generated only using sequential I/O operations, so the whole dump process is efficient even with rotational disks (no random I/O is performed). This is also true for RDB snapshots generation. The complete lack of Random I/O accesses is a rare feature among databases, and is possible mostly because Redis serves read operations from memory, so data on disk does not need to be organized for a random access pattern, but just for a sequential loading on restart.</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting, so usually a database that stores to disk would need to
organize data for efficient random access, but in Redis-land, everything
is loaded into memory.</p>

<p>This confused me:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the additional benefits of RDB is the fact for a given database size, the number of I/Os on the system is bound, whatever the activity on the database is. This is a property that most traditional database systems (and the Redis other persistence, the AOF) do not have.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, AOFs can be large even for empty databases (due to
deletions).</p>

<p>appendfsync:</p>

<ul>
<li>appendfsync no

<ul>
<li>syncs at kernel whim (30 s on linux)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>appendfsync everysec

<ul>
<li>average 1 sec, at most 2 delay before buffers sent to kernel and sync&#8217;d</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>appendfsync always

<ul>
<li>sync before each client ack</li>
<li>slowest</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Default is <code>appendfsync everysec</code>, which is pretty good durability
without murdering speed.</p>

<blockquote><p>What Redis implements when appendfsync is set to always is usually called group commit. This means that instead of using an fsync call for every write operation performed, Redis is able to group this commits in a single write+fsync operation performed before sending the request to the group of clients that issued a write operation during the latest event loop iteration.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hmm that&#8217;s interesting&#8230; Redis has an event loop that can answer
multiple clients in a single iteration?</p>

<p>http://pauladamsmith.com/articles/redis-under-the-hood.html#event-loop</p>

<p>Ah, it uses epoll and the like; multiple sockets and events can have
arrived in one go, so it loops through all of those, does the necessary
reads, etc.</p>

<pre><code>/* Include the best multiplexing layer supported by this system.

<h2>UTF-8</h2>

<ul>
<li>backwards compat w ASCII since ascii only used the 7 bits (signed
char) to determine character.</li>
<li>81% of webpages use this encoding</li>

<h2>hiredis</h2>

<p>https://github.com/redis/hiredis</p>

<p>Presumably stands for &#8220;high(ish) level redis lib&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Ruby gem can optionally use this as a driver but it comes at the
expense of portability (JRuby can&#8217;t use this driver). But by default
Ruby just uses Ruby sockets to talk to redis.</p>

<h2>Public wifi</h2>

<p>Is there any security difference between a password-less public wifi and
one in which literally everyone knows the password?</p>

<h2>/private on os X</h2>

<p>http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/63555/what-is-darwins-private-directory-for</p>

<p>fun fact: <code>/etc</code> is a symlink for <code>/private/etc</code> on OS X. Wacky.</p>

<h2>WEP, WPA, WPA2</h2>

<ul>
<li>WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

<ul>
<li>oldest</li>
<li>WEP 128 most common even though there&#8217;s 256</li>
<li>major security vulnerabilities based on RC4 stream cipher cracking</li>
<li>on busy network, cracking could happen within a minute; if network

<li>passive attacks: you have to collect information. Gather shit.</li>
<li>Shamir (from RSA fame) was one of the crackahs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WPA

<ul>
<li>PSK (pre-shared key) is most common</li>
<li>256 min (over 64 and 128 WEP garbage)</li>
<li>message integrity checks (detects some MITM)</li>
<li>TKIP (temporal key integrity protocol) is predecessor to AES</li>
<li>too tied to WEP (meant for firmware progressive upgrades) and hence
prone to some WEP vulnerabilities, hence:</li>

</li>
<li>WPA2

<ul>
<li>AES</li>
<li>CCMP (replacement for TKIP? but with TKIP fallback)</li>

		<h2>Root/apex/base/DNS and things finally clicking</h2>

<p>They the same thing.</p>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/a/16041655/914123</p>

<p>Also I like</p>

<pre><code>(Note: root, base, apex domains are all the same thing. Using interchangeably for google-foo.)
</code></pre>

<p>CNAME:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canonical Name record: Aliases another name</li>
<li>Use case: define CNAME for <code>ftp</code>, <code>www</code>, etc to point to the
<code>example.com</code> A record so that only the A record&#8217;s IP needs to
change</li>
<li>Can point to any ol domain, not just within <code>example.com</code>. Heroku
and other cloud services use this to have a CNAME pointing to
a domain name under the control of a dynamic name server that
can dish out different A name records (hence different IPs)</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t define CNAMEs for apex domains (e.g. <code>example.com</code>).</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t be shared with other records for that name, e.g. MX. CNAME wins
and fucks over the others, I think.</li>
</ul>


<p>A record:</p>

<ul>
<li>Points to an IP address.</li>
<li>Terminates DNS lookups</li>
</ul>


<p>ALIAS/ANAME:</p>

<p>http://blog.dnsimple.com/2011/11/introducing-alias-record/</p>

<p>http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/differences-between-a-cname-alias-url/</p>

<blockquote><p>Before going further into the details, it’s important to know that A
and CNAME records are standard DNS records, whilst ALIAS and URL
records are custom DNS records provided by DNSimple. Both of them
are translated internally into A records to ensure
compatibility with the DNS protocol.</p></blockquote>

<p>Aliases can coexist with other records at that level (so someone asking
for MX gets MX if defined for that name rather than resolving
elsewhere).</p>

<p>Ok, so DNS hosts just returns CNAMEs and A records (and others too), and
DNS hosts like DNSimple and DNS Made Easy can provide custom record
types that ultimately translate to A records. Makes sense.</p>

<p>So what about URL?</p>

<blockquote><p>This type of record uses an HTTP redirect to redirect visitors from a domain to a web site.</p></blockquote>

<p>So the A record returned from a URL record on DNSimple is going to point
to one of DNSimple&#8217;s server IPs. I set one up for
snaggletooth.alexmatchneer.com => http://www.example.com.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -H "Host: snaggletooth.alexmatchneer.com" 50.31.209.254
&lt;a href="http://www.example.com"&gt;Moved Permanently&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also added a URL record for ugly.alexmatchneer.com to point to some
random s3 image and discovered that browsers in fact follow redirects
for images, hence this works:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="http://ugly.alexmatchneer.com"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://ugly.alexmatchneer.com" alt="" /></p>

<p>DNSimple is also nice enough to append the path to whatever its
forwarding, so <code>ugly.alexmatchneer.com/wat</code> forwards to the destination
specified in the URL record + <code>/wat</code>.</p>

<h2><code>dig</code> recursion</h2>

<p>Either you tell your DNS server to recurse for you, or you do it
yourself.</p>

<p>Name server does it for you (all these options just get rid of crufty
shit):</p>

<pre><code>dig +noall +answer +additional +recurse alexmatchneer.com
alexmatchneer.com.      3544    IN      A       23.235.39.133
</code></pre>

<p>You do it yourself:</p>

<pre><code>dig +noall +answer +additional +norecurse alexmatchneer.com
FWDR-68.FWDR-237.FWDR-161.FWDR-12. 3600 IN A    68.237.161.12
FWDR-71.FWDR-243.FWDR-0.FWDR-12. 3600 IN A      71.243.0.12
</code></pre>

<p>FWDR is a FiOS thing. These are from the additional section. So I guess
it means I should call them. But at what point do I go through
Verizon&#8217;s DNS? I thought I used like 4.2.2.2?</p>

<pre><code>cat /etc/resolve.conf

#
# Mac OS X Notice
#
# This file is not used by the host name and address resolution
# or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by most processes on
# this Mac OS X system.
#
# This file is automatically generated.
#
domain home
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>I guess DNS is decided when I connect to a router. Ahhh I guess routers
perform DNS? Ok ok ok what if I tell <code>dig</code> which name server to query?</p>

<pre><code>$ dig +noall +answer +additional +norecurse @4.2.2.2 alexmatchneer.com
i.gtld-servers.net.     109080  IN      A       192.43.172.30

l.gtld-servers.net.     136989  IN      A       192.41.162.30
</code></pre>

<p>WORD ok top level domains, makes sense. I bet if I let it recurse for me
it&#8217;ll gimme what I want:</p>

<pre><code>$ dig +noall +answer +additional +recurse @4.2.2.2 alexmatchneer.com
alexmatchneer.com.      3600    IN      A       23.235.46.133
</code></pre>

<p>Word. And if I use my router&#8217;s IP:</p>

<pre><code>dig +noall +answer +additional +norecurse @192.168.1.1 alexmatchneer.com
FWDR-68.FWDR-237.FWDR-161.FWDR-12. 3600 IN A    68.237.161.12
FWDR-71.FWDR-243.FWDR-0.FWDR-12. 3600 IN A      71.243.0.12
</code></pre>

<p>It refers me to some Verizon name server shit. Which is why if I type in
some nonsense domain name, I get redirected to some shitty Verizon
search page. Regardless of whether I&#8217;m in Chrome or in curl:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl oinasiodasd.asdasiodasod.asdoi
&lt;!DOCTYPE ... blah blah http://searchassist.verizon.com/
</code></pre>

<p>So what if I enable VPN? Prediction: my VPN provider will be making
queries on my behalf, presumably not behind some Verizon name server
shit.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl oinasiodasd.asdasiodasod.asdoi
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: oinasiodasd.asdasiodasod.asdoi
</code></pre>

<p>Basically (annoying caching hangover aside) dig will skip the FiOS
forwarding/recursing if I&#8217;m on VPN. All this makes sense. Perfect
sense. COMPLICATED THOUGH JESUS.</p>

<h2>VPNs and private network IPs</h2>

<p>ICANN set aside numbers like 192.168&#8230; and 10&#8230; for private networks.
VPN doesn&#8217;t interfere with that shit because it&#8217;s within that range.
Derp.</p>

<p>Ahhhh that does though that I could still use my router as a DNS, no?</p>

<p>VPN enabled:</p>

<pre><code>$ dig .
;; SERVER: 8.8.4.4#53(8.8.4.4)
</code></pre>

<p>VPN disabled:</p>

<pre><code>$ dig .
;; SERVER: 192.168.1.1#53(192.168.1.1)
</code></pre>

<p>And even w VPN enabled I could still query my Verizon router&#8217;s DNS</p>

<pre><code>$ dig +norecurse @192.168.1.1 .
FWDR-68.FWDR-237.FWDR-161.FWDR-12. 3600 IN A    68.237.161.12
FWDR-71.FWDR-243.FWDR-0.FWDR-12. 3600 IN A      71.243.0.12
</code></pre>

<p>So who the hell decides where I query from?</p>

<h2>DHCP</h2>

<p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.</p>

<p>When you connect to a network, this tells you all sorts of useful
defaults:</p>

<blockquote><p>The DHCP server manages a pool of IP addresses and information about client configuration parameters such as default gateway, domain name, the name servers, and time servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>When you connect to a network, the DHCP broadcasting stuff happens and
you wind up with an IP, bingo bango bongo. When you connect to a network
but can&#8217;t establish an IP, it&#8217;s probably because DHCP hasn&#8217;t finished
yet.</p>

<p>But this is where 192.168.1.1 as a name server comes from; the Verizon
router will use DHCP to tell you to use it. Other routers might do other
things. When I tether to my phone it gives a different DNS.</p>

<h2>TXT Records</h2>

<pre><code>$ dig +short borflex.alexmatchneer.com TXT
"Another dumb thing"
"I am a big dumb ridiculous idiot!"
</code></pre>

<h2>Nested subdomains</h2>

<p>For the <code>alexmatchneer.com</code> domain, I added a CNAME for
<code>e.x.c.alexmatchneer.com</code> to point to expresscheckoutapp.com
and now it just works to nav to http://e.x.c.alexmatchneer.com</p>

<h2>Route 53</h2>

<p>Heyyyy that&#8217;s the port that DNS servers use.</p>

<h2>Rubydns</h2>

<p>https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns</p>

<p>Pretty cool. You can make your own DNS server. I got mine to tell me I
was an idiot:</p>

<pre><code>$ dig +short @54.165.102.18 barflonkula TXT
"You are a big idiot"
</code></pre>

<h2>SOA Records</h2>

<h2>Pointilism</h2>

<p>Painting with dots. Like that Ferris Bueller painting, or some of Van
Gogh&#8217;s self portraits.</p>

<h2>Review: difference between pipes and sockets</h2>

<ul>
<li>pipes came first in early 70s</li>
<li>pipes are always stream oriented; sockets can also be datagram

<li>pipes are unidirectional (and require two pipes for back and forth).
sockets are bi-directional.</li>
</ul>


<h2>FAT doesn&#8217;t support hardlinking</h2>

<p>I was going to try ember-cli-ramdisk mounting on file systems other than
HFS+, hoping that one FS would support more efficient reuse of freed
blocks, which might minimize paging on the grounds that if ramdisks
blocks are being reused, then additional ramdisk file allocations won&#8217;t
occur, hence memory lookups won&#8217;t occur, hence paging can&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p>Anyway, got initial builds working in FAT32, but incremental rebuilds
didn&#8217;t work due to hard-linking:</p>

<p>https://github.com/rlivsey/broccoli-concat/blob/master/index.js#L86</p>

<p>I thought we got rid of those, but then again the above use case is
fine, since hardlinks are only used concat output and not root files.</p>

		<h2>HDIutil</h2>

<p>Trying to make some ramdisks on OS X</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil attach -nomount ram://8388608
</code></pre>

<p><code>hdiutil</code> attach will normally try to attach and mount a file system.</p>

<ul>
<li>attach: map a hardware device to some <code>/dev/wat</code> device file</li>
<li>mount: try to read the device, discover its file system, and mount it
as a directory so that you can actually cd into it, access files, etc</li>
</ul>


<p>So <code>-nomount</code> prevents the second step and just generates a dev file
mapped to ram.</p>

<pre><code>diskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAM Disk' /dev/wat
</code></pre>

<h2>What is a volume?</h2>

<p>Seems like a higher-level abstraction over disks and partitions.</p>

<p>http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/whatisvolman.html</p>

<ul>
<li>Move things around more easily</li>
<li>give things better names than <code>/dev/sda</code> / sdb etc</li>
</ul>


<p>Basically let&#8217;s you overlay logical volumes on top of physical drives.
Makes it easy to move space around between various drives, make things
more sane.</p>

<pre><code>    hda1   hdc1      (PV:s on partitions or whole disks)                        
       \   /                                                                    
        \ /                                                                     
       diskvg        (VG)

<p>Use LVM2 in Linux land.</p>

<h2>tcpdump</h2>

<p>Ahhh got it to work</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo tcpdump -t 'host machty.com'
$ ping machty.com
IP 192.168.109.90 &gt; pages.github.com: ICMP echo request, id 24129, seq 0, length 64

IP pages.github.com &gt; 192.168.109.90: ICMP echo reply, id 24129, seq 2, length 64
</code></pre>

<h2>UDP can broad/multicast</h2>

<p>And TCP cannot?</p>

<h2>Sequenced-packet sockets</h2>

<p>Combined aspects of UDP/TCP.</p>

<ul>
<li>Connection oriented</li>
<li>Datagram oriented (message boundaries preserved)</li>
<li>Reliable</li>
</ul>


<p><code>SOCK_SEQPACKET</code> type, available in UNIX domain. TCP/UDP do not support
it, but SCTP does.</p>

<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Allows stream multiplexing,
preserves message boundaries unlike TCP.</p>

<pre><code>socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP);
</code></pre>

<p>So, TCP isn&#8217;t the only internet-domain stream protocol; SCTP is too.
It&#8217;s a stream of messages. Rather than bytes.</p>

<p>UDP + congestion controller = DCCP, Datagram Congestion Control
Protocol.</p>

<h2>Alternative IO</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>select</code>/<code>poll</code> to watch multiple fds for availability;

<ul>
<li>benefit over alternatives is that you don&#8217;t have to manually poll w non-blocking
reads.</li>
<li>doesn&#8217;t scale well w hundreds+ of FDs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>signal-driven IO; kernel notifies when IO ready, process can do other
still til its ready for IO; benefit over select/poll is that it
doesn&#8217;t block</li>
<li>epoll

<ul>
<li>application can monitor many file descriptors</li>
<li>linux specific but BSD has kqueue, and there are others</li>
<li>avoids complexities w signal programming</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s also POSIX async IO (AIO); perform IO but don&#8217;t block, get
notified later when it goes through. Linux has thread implementation but
might have it on kernel now, who knows.</p>

<p>Since <code>epoll</code> is Linux specific, use a lib that provides a portal
evented layer to you process: use epoll if present, else fall back to
select/pool; <code>libevent</code> is one such lib.</p>

<ul>
<li>libevent

<ul>
<li>libev: high perf event loop based on libevent but without bugs

<ul>
<li>only ran on Unix, so node (which originally use libev) needed a
solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>libuv: abstraction around libev or IOCP (Windows-based IO Completion
Port)

<ul>
<li>used in node</li>
<li>used in rust</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Two types of readiness notifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>level-triggered: fd is actually ready, now, for IO

<ul>
<li>poll/select &amp; epoll</li>
<li>Allows you to repeat the poll operation after a small read; no need
to read everything in a buffer at once</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>edge-triggered: IO has occurred since last poll (but it&#8217;s possible
someone else already took care of it)

<ul>
<li>signals &amp; epoll</li>
<li>Try and read as much as possible because you have no way of knowing
whether there&#8217;s more data (without a non-blocking fail), usually by
non-blocking reads in a loop until EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that epoll can do both. These constraints impact program design.</p>

<p>Non-blocking IO + edge-triggered notifications is common because there
are so many cases where blocking IO will screw you; better to non-block
in a lop and check if data is actually there.</p>

<p><code>poll</code> is like <code>select</code> but instead of grouping by operation you just
provide a list of FDs objects and say which type of IO you&#8217;re interested
in per object.</p>

<p>Readiness means an operation will not block. It doesn&#8217;t mean data will
transfer as it could mean EOF or error. The only guarantee is
non-blockage.</p>

<p>Downsides w poll/select when large number of FDs</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to initialize large structures to pass to kernel</li>
<li>Kernel needs to loop through all file descriptors</li>
<li>Program must inspect all returned FDs</li>
</ul>


<h2>Stripe</h2>

<p>You can do a one time charge, or you can save card to a customer.</p>

<p>You can create a Card in their API, but you must specify a customer or
recipient.</p>

<p>An OAuth access token acts like a secret API key:</p>

<blockquote><p>To swap this for an access_token, which acts like a secret API key&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>https://stripe.com/docs/connect/getting-started</p>

<p>So this error: https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-publishable-key-error-with-shared-customers</p>

<p>Background: every Stripe API request sends in your app&#8217;s secret key for
authentication.</p>

<pre><code>Stripe.api_key = ENV['YOUR_DUMBASS_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY']
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it send automatically, but you can also override per API
request by providing a second parameter.</p>

<pre><code>charge = Stripe::Charge.create({
  ...
}, some_api_key)
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the issue was that my implicitly provided app api key was
being provided to the API request to make a charge using a token
generated by the connected account.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really know why this is a problem; seems like something you
should be able to do, right? But actually you have to provide that
second parameter as the access token from when the account connected to
your app.</p>

<p>Trickay.</p>

<h2>Who&#8217;s using ports in OS X?</h2>

<pre><code>sudo lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
</code></pre>

<p>Figured I&#8217;d be able to use netstat for this, should probably look into
why I can&#8217;t.</p>

<h2>Self pipes</h2>

<p>Because <code>pselect</code> isn&#8217;t widely supported, you can use the self pipe
trick to get rid of race conditions surrounding signal handlers and
select. Recall the common race condition:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install signal handler that sets global flag to true</li>
<li>Run an IO loop that checks this global flag in order to decide whether
to perform some action.</li>
</ul>


<p>But if a signal arrives between these steps then you might start looping
without checking the flag, etc.</p>

<p>So you can self-pipe to get around this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a unix domain pipe, non-blocking on both ends to prevent any
sort of queueing/blocking behavior.</li>
<li>Within a signal handler, write a single byte into the pipe; <code>write</code>
is async signal safe, so we&#8217;re cool.</li>
<li>Include the pipe in <code>select</code>, always check if self-pipe is in
<code>readfs</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Unicorn uses a self pipe.</p>

<pre><code># We use SELF_PIPE differently in the master and worker processes:
#
# * The master process never closes or reinitializes this once
# initialized.  Signal handlers in the master process will write to
# it to wake up the master from IO.select in exactly the same manner
# djb describes in http://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html
#
# * The workers immediately close the pipe they inherit.  See the
# Unicorn::Worker class for the pipe workers use.
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Richard Stevens&#8217;s 1992 book &#8220;Advanced programming in the UNIX environment&#8221; says that you can&#8217;t safely mix select() or poll() with SIGCHLD (or other signals). The SIGCHLD might go off while select() is starting, too early to interrupt it, too late to change its timeout.</p></blockquote>

<p>This just means race conditions; anyway, Unicorn doesn&#8217;t mix select with
other FDs; rather it uses it as parent-child process communication; the
master will sleep/block on a select of the self pipe, and only the self
pipe, and will awaken, clear the pipe, and continue onward.</p>
